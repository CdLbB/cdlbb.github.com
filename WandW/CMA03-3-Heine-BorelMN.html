<h3 id="theconceptofuniformity.">3.5 The concept of uniformity.</h3>

<p>There are processes other than that of summing a series in which the idea
of uniformity is of importance. </p>

<p>Let <span class="math">\(\epsilon\)</span> be an arbitrary positive number; and let <span class="math">\(f(z, \zeta)\)</span> be a function of
two variables <span class="math">\(z\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\zeta\)</span>, which, for each point <span class="math">\(z\)</span> of a closed region, satisfies the inequality <span class="math">\(\left|\,f(z, \zeta) \right| < \epsilon\)</span> when <span class="math">\(\zeta\)</span> is given any one of a certain set of values which will be denoted by <span class="math">\((\zeta_z)\)</span>; the particular set of values of course depends on the particular value of <span class="math">\(\zeta\)</span> under consideration. If a set <span class="math">\((\zeta)_0\)</span> can be found such that every member of the set <span class="math">\((\zeta)_0\)</span> is a member of all the sets <span class="math">\((\zeta_z)\)</span>, the function <span class="math">\(f(z, f)\)</span> is said to satisfy the inequality <em>uniformly</em> for all points <span class="math">\(z\)</span> of the region. And if a function <span class="math">\( \phi(z) \)</span> possesses some property, for every positive value of <span class="math">\(\epsilon\)</span>, in virtue of the inequality <span class="math">\(\left|\,f(z, \zeta) \right| < \epsilon,\;  \phi(z)\)</span> is then said to <em>possess the property uniformly.</em> </p>

<p>In addition to the uniformity of convergence of series and products, we shall have
to consider uniformity of convergence of integrals and also uniformity of continuity; thus a series is uniformly convergent when <span class="math">\(\left|R_n(z)\right|< \epsilon,\; n ( = \zeta) \)</span> assuming integer values independent of <span class="math">\(z\)</span> only. </p>

<p>Further, a function <span class="math">\(f(z)\)</span> is continuous in a closed region if, given <span class="math">\(\epsilon\)</span>, we can find a positive number <span class="math">\(\zeta_z\)</span> such that <span class="math">\(\left|\, f(z +\eta )\right| < \epsilon\)</span> whenever <span class="math">\(0 < \eta < \zeta\)</span>
and <span class="math">\(z+\eta\)</span> is a point of the region. </p>

<p>The function will be <em>uniformly</em> continuous if we can find a positive number <span class="math">\(\zeta\)</span> <em>independent</em> of <span class="math">\(z\)</span>, such that <span class="math">\(\zeta \leq \zeta_z\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\left|\, f(z +\eta )\right| < \epsilon\)</span> whenever <span class="math">\(0 < \eta< \zeta_z\)</span>
and <span class="math">\(z+\eta\)</span> is a point of the region, (in this case the set <span class="math">\((\zeta)_0\)</span> is the set of points whose moduli are less than <span class="math">\(\zeta\)</span>). </p>

<p>We shall find later (<a href="#uniformityofcontinuity.">&#167;3.61</a>) that continuity involves uniformity of continuity; this is
in marked contradistinction to the fact that convergence does not involve uniformity
of convergence. </p>

<div class="contenttext">

<p>This process of bisecting intervals which are not suitable either will
terminate or it will not. If it does terminate, the theorem is proved, for <span class="math">\(CD\)</span>
will have been divided into suitable intervals. </p>

<p>Suppose that the process does not terminate; and let an interval, which
can be divided into suitable intervals by the process of bisection just described,
be said to satisfy condition (B). </p>

<p>Then, by hypothesis, <span class="math">\(CD\)</span> does not satisfy condition (B); therefore at least
one of the bisected portions of <span class="math">\(CD\)</span> does not satisfy condition (B). Take that
one which does not (if neither satisfies condition (B) take the left-hand one);
bisect it and select that bisected part which does not satisfy condition (B).
This process of bisection and selection gives an unending sequence of intervals
<span class="math">\(s_0 , s_1, s_2 , \dots \)</span> such that:</p>

<ol>
<li>The length of <span class="math">\(s_n\)</span> is <span class="math">\(2^{-n} CD\)</span>.</li>
<li>No point of <span class="math">\(s_{n+1}\)</span> is outside <span class="math">\(s_n\)</span>.</li>
<li>The interval <span class="math">\(s_n\)</span> does not satisfy condition (A).</li>
</ol>

<p>Let the distances of the end points of <span class="math">\(s_n\)</span> from <em>C</em> be <span class="math">\(x_n ,\, y_n \)</span>; then
<span class="math">\(x_n  \leq x_{n+1} < y_{n+1} \leq y_n\)</span>. Therefore, by <a href="CMA02-1-LimitsMN.html#thelimitofanincreasingsequence">&#167;2.2</a>, <span class="math">\(x_n\)</span> and <span class="math">\(y_n\)</span> have limits; and, by the condition (i) above, these limits are the same, say <span class="math">\(\xi\)</span>; let <em>Q</em> be the point whose distance from is <span class="math">\(\xi\)</span>. But, by hypothesis, there is a number <span class="math">\(\delta_Q\)</span> such that every point of <span class="math">\(CD\)</span>, whose distance from <em>Q</em> is less than <span class="math">\(\delta_Q\)</span>, is a point of the associated interval <span class="math">\(I (Q)\)</span>. Choose <em>n</em> so large that <span class="math">\(2^{ -n} CD< \delta_Q\)</span>; then <em>Q</em> is an internal point or end point of <span class="math">\(s_n\)</span> and the distance of every point of <span class="math">\(s_n\)</span> from <em>Q</em> is less than <span class="math">\(\delta_Q\)</span>. And therefore the interval <span class="math">\(s_n\)</span> satisfies condition (A), which is contrary to condition (iii) above. The hypothesis that the process of bisecting intervals does not terminate therefore involves a contradiction; therefore the process does terminate and the theorem is proved. </p>

<p>From the theorem just proved, it follows without difficulty that if a

<p>For let <span class="math">\(\epsilon\)</span> be an arbitrary positive number; then, in virtue of the continuity of <span class="math">\(f(x)\)</span>, corresponding to any value of <em>x</em>, we can find a positive
number <span class="math">\(\delta_x\)</span> depending on <em>x</em>, such that
<span class="math">\[\left|\, f(x')-f(x) \right|< \frac{1}{4}\epsilon \]</span>
for all values of <span class="math">\(x'\)</span> such that <span class="math">\(\left|\, x' - x \,\right| < \delta_x\)</span>. </p>

<p>Then by <a href="#themodifiedheine-boreltheorem.">&#167;3.6</a> we can divide the range <span class="math">\([a, b]\)</span> into a <em>finite</em> number of closed intervals with the property that in each interval there is a number <span class="math">\(x_1\)</span> such that <span class="math">\(\left|\, f(x') - f(x_1) \right| < \frac{1}{4}\epsilon\)</span>, whenever <span class="math">\(x'\)</span> lies in the interval in which <span class="math">\(x_1\)</span> lies. </p>

<p>Let <span class="math">\(\delta_0\)</span> be the length of the smallest of these intervals; and let <span class="math">\(\xi, \, \xi'\)</span> be <em>any</em> two numbers in the closed range <span class="math">\([a, b]\)</span> such that <span class="math">\(\left| \xi - \xi' \right| < \delta_0\)</span>. Then <span class="math">\(\xi, \, \xi'\)</span> lie in the same or in adjacent intervals; if they lie in adjacent intervals let <span class="math">\(\xi_0\)</span> be the common end point. Then we can find numbers <span class="math">\(x_1, \, x_2\)</span>, one in each interval, such that
<span class="math">\[
\begin{align*}
\left|\,f(\xi)-f(x_1)\right| < \frac{1}{4}\epsilon, \quad & \quad \left|\,f(\xi_0)-f(x_1)\right| < \frac{1}{4}\epsilon, \\

so that
<span class="math">\[
\begin{align*}
\left|\,f(\xi)-f(\xi')\right|=& \left|\left\{\,f(\xi)-f(x_1)\right\}-\left\{\,f(\xi_0)-f(x_1)\right\}\right.\\
&\left.+\left\{\,f(\xi_0)-f(x_2)\right\}-\left\{\,f(\xi')-f(x_2)\right\}\right|\\
< & \epsilon.
\end{align*}
\]</span></p>

<p>If <span class="math">\(\xi, \, \xi'\)</span> lie in the same interval, we can prove similarly that
<span class="math">\[\left|\,f(\xi)-f(\xi')\right|< \frac{1}{2}\epsilon.\]</span></p>

<p>In either case we have shewn that, for any number <span class="math">\(\xi\)</span> in the range, we have
<span class="math">\[\left|\,f(\xi)-f(\xi+\zeta)\right|< \epsilon.\]</span>

<p>Let <span class="math">\(M,\, m\)</span> be the upper and lower bounds of <span class="math">\(f(x)\)</span>; then we can find numbers <span class="math">\(\underline{x}, \,\overline{x}\)</span>, by <a href="#arealfunctionofarealvariablecontinuousinaclosedintervalattainsitsupperbound.">&#167;3.62</a>, such that <span class="math">\(f(\overline{x}) = M,\,f(\underline{x}) = m\)</span>; let <span class="math">\(\mu\)</span> be any number such that <span class="math">\(m < \mu < M\)</span>. Given any positive number <span class="math">\(\epsilon\)</span>, we can (by <a href="#uniformityofcontinuity.">&#167;3.61</a>) divide the range <span class="math">\([\underline{x},\, \overline{x}]\)</span> into a finite number, <em>r</em>, of closed intervals such that
<span class="math">\[\left|\,f(x_1^{(r)}) -f(x_2^{(r)}) \right| < \epsilon,\]</span>
where <span class="math">\(x_1^{(r)}, \, x_2^{(r)}\)</span> are any points of the <em>r</em>th interval; take <span class="math">\(x_1^{(r)}, \, x_2^{(r)}\)</span> to be the end points of the interval; then there is at least one of the intervals for which <span class="math">\(f(x_1^{(r)})-\mu, \:  f(x_2^{(r)})-\mu\)</span> have opposite signs;<a class="marginmark" onClick="toggleHide('mn:12,-10');">&#91;12&#93;</a> and since
<span class="math">\[\left|\{f(x_1^{(r)})-\mu\} - \{f(x_2^{(r)})-\mu\} \right| < \epsilon,\]</span>
it follows that <span class="math">\[\left|\,f(x_1^{(r)}) - \mu\right| < \epsilon.\]</span></p>

<p>Since we can find a number <span class="math">\(x_1^{(r)}\)</span> to satisfy this inequality for all values

<div class="marginnotes"  id="mn:13,-1"  style="margin-top: -1em; margin-bottom: -1em;"><a class="marginmark">&#91;13&#93;</a>The terminology of this section is partly that of Hobson, <a href="http://archive.org/details/theoryfunctions00hobsgoog"><em>The Theory of Functions of a Real Variable</em> (1907)</a> and partly that of Young, <a href="https://archive.org/details/theoryofsetsofpo00youniala"><em>The Theory of Sets of Points</em> (1906)</a>. <a onClick="hideIt('mn:13,-1')" title="hide margin note" class="reversefootnote">&#160;&#8617;</a>

<p>Let <span class="math">\(f(x)\)</span> be a real bounded function, defined when <span class="math">\(a \leq x \leq b\)</span>. Let
<span class="math">\[a \leq x_1 \leq x_2 \leq \cdots \leq x_n \leq b.\]</span></p>

<p>Then
<span class="math">\[\left|\, f(a) -f( x_1 ) \right| + \left|\, f(x_1) -f( x_2 ) \right| +  \cdots +\left|\, f(x_n) -f( b ) \right| + \]</span> is called the fluctuation of <span class="math">\(f(x)\)</span> in the range <span class="math">\([a, b]\)</span> for the set of subdivisions <span class="math">\(x_1, \, x_2, \, \cdots , \, x_n\)</span>. If the fluctuation have an upper bound <span class="math">\(F_a^{\,b}\)</span>, independent of <em>n</em>, for all choices of <span class="math">\(x_1, \, x_2, \, \cdots , \, x_n\)</span>, then <span class="math">\(f(x)\)</span> is said to have limited total fluctuation in the range
<span class="math">\([a, b]\)</span>. <span class="math">\(F_a^{\,b}\)</span> is called the total fluctuation in the range. </p>

<p>Example 3.
