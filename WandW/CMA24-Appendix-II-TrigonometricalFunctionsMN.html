<p>The functions <span class="math">\(\sin z\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\cos z\)</span> are defined analytically by means of power series,<a class="marginmark" onClick="toggleHide('mn:1,+2');">&#91;1&#93;</a> thus

\end{align*}\]</span>
these series converge absolutely for all values of <span class="math">\(z\)</span> (real and complex) by <a href="CMA02-2-SeriesMN.html#ratiotest">&#167;2.36</a>, and so the definitions are valid for all values of <span class="math">\(z\)</span>. </p>

<p>On comparing these series with the exponential series, it is apparent that the sine and cosine are not essentially new functions, but they can be expressed in terms of exponential functions by the equations <a class="marginmark" onClick="toggleHide('mn:2,-6');">&#91;2&#93;</a>
<span class="math">\[2i \sin z = \exp(iz) - \exp( - iz), \quad  2 \cos z = \exp(iz) + \exp ( - iz).\]</span> </p>
</div>
<div class="marginnotes"  id="mn:2,-6"  style="margin-top: -6em; margin-bottom: -6em;"><a class="marginmark">&#91;2&#93;</a>These equations were derived by Euler [they were given in a letter to Johann Bernoulli in 1740 and published in the <a href="http://eulerarchive.maa.org/pages/E170.html"><em>Hist. Acad. Berlin.</em> <strong>v.</strong> (1749)</a>, p. 279] from the geometrical definitions of the sine and cosine, upon which the theory of the circular functions was then universally based. <a onClick="hideIt('mn:2,-6')" title="hide margin note" class="reversefootnote">&#160;&#8617;</a>

<div class="contenttext">

<p>It is obvious that <span class="math">\(\sin z\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\cos z\)</span> are odd and even functions of <span class="math">\(z\)</span> respectively; that is to say
<span class="math">\[\sin (-z)= -\sin z, \quad \cos (-z) = \cos z.\]</span> </p>

<h4 id="a.41thefundamentalpropertiesofsinandcos.">A.41 The fundamental properties of <span class="math">\(\sin z\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\cos z\)</span>.</h4>

<p>It may be proved, just as in the case of the exponential function (<a href="CMA24-Appendix-I-LogrithmAndExponentialMN.html#a.2theexponentialfunction.">&#167;A.2</a>), that the series for <span class="math">\(\sin z\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\cos z\)</span> converge uniformly in any bounded domain of values of <span class="math">\(z\)</span>, and consequently that <span class="math">\(\sin z\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\cos z\)</span> are continuous functions of <span class="math">\(z\)</span> for all values of <span class="math">\(z\)</span>. </p>

<p>Further, it may be proved in a similar manner that the series
<span class="math">\[ 1-\frac{x^2}{3!}+\frac{z^4}{5!}- \cdots\]</span>
defines a continuous function of <span class="math">\(z\)</span> for all values of <span class="math">\(z\)</span>, and, in particular, this function is continuous at <span class="math">\(z = 0\)</span>, and so it follows that
<span class="math">\[\lim_{z \rightarrow 0} (z^{-1} \sin z) = 1.\]</span> </p>

<h4 id="a.42theaddition-theoremsforsinandcos.">A.42 The addition-theorems for <span class="math">\(\sin z\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\cos z\)</span>.</h4>

<p>By using Euler&#8217;s equations (<a href="#a.4thedefinitionofthesineandcosine.">&#167;A.4</a>), it is easy to prove from properties of the exponential function that
<span class="math">\[\sin (z_1 + z_2 ) = \sin z_1 \cos z_2 + \cos z_1 \sin z_2\]</span>
and
<span class="math">\[\cos (z_1 + z_2) = \cos z_1 \cos z_2 - \sin z_1 \sin z_2 ;\]</span>
these results are known as <em>the addition-theorems</em> for <span class="math">\(\sin z\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\cos z\)</span>. </p>

<p>It may also be proved, by using Euler&#8217;s equations, that
<span class="math">\[\sin^2 z + \cos^2 z=1.\]</span> </p>

<p>By means of this result, <span class="math">\(\sin(z_1 + z_2 )\)</span> can be expressed as an algebraic function of <span class="math">\(\sin z_1\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\sin z_2\)</span>, while <span class="math">\(\cos (z_1 + z_2 )\)</span> can similarly be expressed as an algebraic function of <span class="math">\(\cos z_1\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\cos z_2\)</span>; so the addition-formulae may be regarded as addition-theorems in the strict sense (cf. <a href="whereOwhere.html">&#167;20.3</a>,
<a href="whereOwhere.html">&#167;22.732 note</a>). </p>

<p>By differentiating Euler&#8217;s equations, it is obvious that
<span class="math">\[\frac{d \sin z}{dz} = \cos z, \quad \frac{d \cos z}{dz} = -\sin z.\]</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Example</em>. Shew that
<span class="math">\[\sin 2z = 2 \sin z \cos z, \quad \cos 2z = 2\cos^2 z - 1;\]</span>
these results are known as the duplication-formulae. </p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="a.5theperiodicityoftheexponentialfunction.">A.5 The periodicity of the exponential function.</h3>

<p>If <span class="math">\(z_1\)</span> and <span class="math">\(z_2\)</span> are such that <span class="math">\(\exp z_1 = \exp z_2\)</span>, then, multiplying both sides of the equation by <span class="math">\(\exp ( -z_2 )\)</span>, we get <span class="math">\(\exp (z_1 - z_2) = 1\)</span>; and writing <span class="math">\(\gamma\)</span> for <span class="math">\(z_1 - z_2\)</span>, we see that, for all values of <span class="math">\(z\)</span> and all integral values of <span class="math">\(n\)</span>,
<span class="math">\[\exp (z + n\gamma) = (\exp x ) (\exp \gamma)^n = \exp z.\]</span> </p>

<p>The exponential function is then said <em>to have period</em> <span class="math">\(\gamma\)</span>, since the effect of increasing <span class="math">\(z\)</span> by <span class="math">\(\gamma\)</span>, or by an integral multiple thereof, does not affect the value of the function. </p>
</div>
<div class="marginnotes"  id="mn:3,+3"  style="margin-top: +3em; margin-bottom: +3em;"><a class="marginmark">&#91;3&#93;</a>The fact that <span class="math">\(\pi\)</span> is an irrational number, whose value is <span class="math">\(3.14159 \dots \,\)</span>, is irrelevant to the present investigation. For an account of attempts at determining the value of <span class="math">\(\pi\)</span>, concluding with a proof of the theorem that <span class="math">\(\pi\)</span> satisfies no algebraic equation with rational coefficients, see Hobson&#8217;s monograph <a href="https://archive.org/details/squaringcirclehi00hobsuoft"><em>Squaring the Circle</em></a> (1913). <a onClick="hideIt('mn:3,+3')" title="hide margin note" class="reversefootnote">&#160;&#8617;</a>
</div>
<div class="contenttext">

<p>It will now be shewn that such numbers <span class="math">\(\gamma\)</span> (other than zero) actually exist, and that <em>all</em> the numbers <span class="math">\(\gamma\)</span>, possessing the property just described, are comprised in the expression
<span class="math">\[\qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad 2n\pi i,\qquad \quad  (n=\pm 1, \pm  2 , \pm 3, \cdots )\]</span>
where <span class="math">\(\pi\)</span> is a certain positive number which happens to be greater than <span class="math">\(2\sqrt{2}\)</span> and less than <span class="math">\(4\)</span>.<a class="marginmark" onClick="toggleHide('mn:3,+3');">&#91;3&#93;</a> </p>

<h4 id="a.51thesolutionoftheequation.">A.51 The solution of the equation <span class="math">\(\exp \gamma = 1\)</span>.</h4>

<p>Let <span class="math">\(\gamma = \alpha + i\beta\)</span>, where <span class="math">\(\alpha\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\beta\)</span> are real; then the problem of solving the equation
<span class="math">\(\exp \gamma = 1\)</span> is identical with that of solving the equation
<span class="math">\[(\exp \alpha) (\exp i\beta)=1.\]</span>
Comparing the real and imaginary parts of each side of this equation, we have
<span class="math">\[(\exp \alpha) (\cos \beta)=1, \quad (\exp \alpha) (\sin \beta)=0. \]</span>
Squaring and adding these equations, and using the identity <span class="math">\(\cos^2 \beta + \sin^2 \beta = 1\)</span>, we get
<span class="math">\[\exp 2\alpha=1.\]</span>
Now if <span class="math">\(\alpha\)</span> were positive, <span class="math">\(\exp 2\alpha\)</span> would be greater than <span class="math">\(1\)</span>, and if <span class="math">\(\alpha\)</span> were negative, <span class="math">\(\exp 2\alpha\)</span>
would be less than <span class="math">\(1\)</span>; <em>and so the only possible value for <span class="math">\(\alpha\)</span> is zero.</em> It follows that <span class="math">\(\cos \beta = 1\)</span>, <span class="math">\(\sin \beta = 0\)</span>. </p>

<p>Now the equation <span class="math">\(\sin \beta = 0\)</span> is a necessary consequence of the equation <span class="math">\(\cos \beta = 1\)</span>, on account of the identity <span class="math">\(\cos^2 \beta + \sin^2 \beta = 1\)</span>. It is therefore sufficient to consider solutions (if such solutions exist) of the equation <span class="math">\(\cos \beta = 1\)</span>. </p>

<p>Instead, however, of considering the equation <span class="math">\(\cos \beta = 1\)</span>, it is more convenient to consider the equation <span class="math">\(\cos \beta=0\)</span>.<a class="marginmark" onClick="toggleHide('mn:4,-2');">&#91;4&#93;</a> </p>

<p>It follows from (ii) and (iii) combined with the results of (i) and of <a href="CMA03-3-Heine-BorelMN.html#arealfunctionofarealvariablecontinuousinaclosedintervalattainsallvaluesbetweenitsupperandlowerbounds.">&#167;3.63</a> that the equation <span class="math">\(\cos x =0\)</span> has <em>at least</em> one root in the range <span class="math">\(\sqrt{2} < x <  2\)</span>, and it has no root in the range <span class="math">\(0 \leq x \leq  \sqrt{2}\)</span>. </p>

<p>Further, there is <em>not more than</em> one root in the range <span class="math">\(\sqrt{2} < x <  2\)</span>; for, suppose that there were two, <span class="math">\(x_1\)</span> and <span class="math">\(x_2\,\)</span> <span class="math">\((x_2 > x_1)\)</span>; then <span class="math">\(0 < x_2 - x_1 < 2 - \sqrt{2} < 1\)</span>, and

<p><em>The equation <span class="math">\(\cos x=0\)</span> therefore has one and only one root lying between and <span class="math">\(2\)</span>.</em> This

that <span class="math">\(\sin(x_1 - x_2) = 0\)</span>, and this would contradict <a href="#a.51itemiv">&#167;A.51 (iv)</a>, since
<span class="math">\[0 < \left|\, x_1 - x_2 \,\right| \leq \tfrac{1}{2}\pi < 2.\]</span>
Further, <span class="math">\(\sin x_1 = +\sqrt{(1 - \cos^2 x_1)}= + \sqrt{(1 - \lambda^2 )} = \mu\)</span>, so <span class="math">\(x_1\)</span> is a solution of <em>both</em> equations. </p>

<p>The equations have no solutions in the ranges <span class="math">\([-\pi, 0]\)</span> and <span class="math">\([\frac{1}{2}\pi,  \pi]\)</span> since, in these ranges, either <span class="math">\(\sin x\)</span> or <span class="math">\(\cos x\)</span> is negative. Thus the equations have one solution, and only one, in the range <span class="math">\([ -\pi, \pi]\)</span>. </p>

<p>If <span class="math">\(\lambda\)</span> or <span class="math">\(\mu\)</span> (or both) is negative, we may investigate the equations in a similar manner; the details are left to the reader. </p>

<p>It is obvious that, if <span class="math">\(x_1\)</span> is a solution of the equations, so also is <span class="math">\(x_1 + 2n\pi\)</span>, where <span class="math">\(n\)</span> is any integer, and therefore the equations have an infinity of real solutions. </p>
