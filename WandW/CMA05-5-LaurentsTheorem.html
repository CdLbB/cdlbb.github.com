<h3 id="5.6laurentstheorem.">5.6 Laurent&#8217;s Theorem.</h3>

<p>A very important theorem was published in 1843 by Laurent;<a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[1]</a> it relates to expansions of functions to which Taylor&#8217;s Theorem cannot be applied. </p>

<p>Let <span class="math">\(C\)</span> and <span class="math">\(C'\)</span> be two concentric circles of centre <span class="math">\(a\)</span>, of which <span class="math">\(C'\)</span> is the inner; and let <span class="math">\(f(z)\)</span> be a function which is analytic at all points on <span class="math">\(C\)</span> and <span class="math">\(C'\)</span> and throughout the annulus<a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[2]</a> between <span class="math">\(C\)</span> and <span class="math">\(C'\)</span>. Let <span class="math">\(a + h\)</span> be any point in this
ring-shaped space. Then we have (<a href="CMA05-2-CauchysTheorem.html#5.21corollary">§5.21 corollary</a>)
<span class="math">\[f(a+h)=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\! \int_C \frac{f(z)}{z-a-h} dz - \frac{1}{2\pi i}\! \int_{C'} \frac{f(z)}{z-a-h} dz,\]</span>
where the integrals are supposed taken in the positive or counter-clockwise
direction round the circles. </p>

<p>This can be written
<span class="math">\[\begin{align*}
&f(a+h)=\\ \\
&\quad \frac{1}{2\pi i}\! \int_C \! f(z)\left\{\frac{1}{z-a}+\frac{h}{(z-a)^2}+\cdots +\frac{h^n}{(z-a)^{n+1}}+\frac{h^{n+1}}{(z-a)^{n+1}(z-a-h)}\right\}\, dz\\ \\
&\qquad +\frac{1}{2\pi i}\! \int_{C'} \! f(z)\left\{\frac{1}{h}+\frac{z-a}{h^2}+\cdots +\frac{(z-a)^n}{h^{n+1}}+\frac{(z-a)^{n+1}}{h^{n+1}(z-a-h)}\right\}\, dz.
\end{align*}\]</span>
We find, as <a href="CMA05-3-TaylorsTheorem.html#5.4termvanishes">in the proof of Taylor&#8217;s Theorem</a>, that
<span class="math">\[\int_C \frac{f(z)\,h^{n+1}dz}{(z-a)^{n+1}(z-a-h)}\; \text{and} \; \int_{C'} \frac{f(z)\,(z-a)^{n+1}dz}{h^{n+1}(z-a-h)}\]</span>
tend to zero as <span class="math">\(n \rightarrow \infty\)</span>; and thus we have
<span class="math">\[f(a+h)= a_0+a_1h+a_2h^2+ \cdots +\frac{b_1}{h}+\frac{b_2}{h}+ \cdots,\]</span>
where<a href="#fn:3" id="fnref:3" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[3]</a> <span class="math">\(\displaystyle a_n =  \frac{1}{2\pi i}\! \int_C \frac{f(z)\,dz}{(z-a)^{n+1}}\)</span>, and <span class="math">\(\displaystyle  b_n = \frac{1}{2\pi i}\! \int_{C'} \!(z-a)^{n-1}f(z)\,dz\)</span>. </p>

<p>This result is <em>Laurent&#8217;s Theorem</em>; changing the notation, it can be
expressed in the following form : <em>If <span class="math">\(f(z)\)</span> be analytic on the concentric circles <span class="math">\(C\)</span> and <span class="math">\(C'\)</span> of centre <span class="math">\(a\)</span>, and throughout&#8217; the annulus between them, then at any point <span class="math">\(z\)</span> of the annulus <span class="math">\(f(z)\)</span> can be expanded in the form</em>
<span class="math">\[f(z) = a_0 + a_1(z - a) + a_2 (z - a)^2 + \cdots + \frac{b_1}{(z-a)} + \frac{b_2}{(z-a)^2} + \cdots, \]</span>
<em>where</em> <span class="math">\(\displaystyle a_n =  \frac{1}{2\pi i}\! \int_C \frac{f(t)\,dt}{(t-a)^{n+1}}\)</span>,
<em>and</em> <span class="math">\(\displaystyle  b_n = \frac{1}{2\pi i}\! \int_{C'} \!(t-a)^{n-1}f(t)\,dt\)</span>. </p>

<p>An important case of Laurent&#8217;s Theorem arises when there is only one
singularity within the inner circle <span class="math">\(C'\)</span>, namely at the centre <span class="math">\(a\)</span>. In this case the circle <span class="math">\(C'\)</span> can be taken as small as we please, and so Laurent&#8217;s expansion is valid for all points in the interior of the circle <span class="math">\(C\)</span>, except the centre <span class="math">\(a\)</span>. </p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Example</em> 1. Prove that
<span class="math">\[\begin{align*}
e^{\frac{x}{2}\left(z-\frac{1}{z}\right)} =& J_0 (x)+zJ_1 (x) + z^2 J_2 (x) + \cdots +z^n J_n (x) + \cdots \\
& \quad -\frac{1}{z} J_1 (x)+\frac{1}{z^2} J_2 (x)- \cdots +\frac{(-1)^n}{z^n} J_n (x) + \cdots, 
\end{align*}\]</span>
where <span class="math">\[J_n(x) = \frac{1}{2\pi}\!\int_0^{2\pi} \! \cos(n\theta - x sin \theta ) \,d\theta.\]</span> </p>

<p>[For the function of <span class="math">\(z\)</span> under consideration is analytic in any domain which does not
include the point <span class="math">\(z=0\)</span>; and so by Laurent&#8217;s Theorem,
<span class="math">\[e^{\frac{x}{2}\left(z-\frac{1}{z}\right)} =a_0 + a_1z + a_2 z^2 + \cdots + \frac{b_1}{z} + \frac{b_2}{z^2} + \cdots,\]</span>
where <span class="math">\(\displaystyle a_n =  \frac{1}{2\pi i}\! \int_C e^{\frac{x}{2}\left(z-\frac{1}{z}\right)}\frac{dz}{z^{n+1}}\)</span>, and <span class="math">\(\displaystyle  b_n = \frac{1}{2\pi i}\! \int_{C'} \!e^{\frac{x}{2}\left(z-\frac{1}{z}\right)}z^{n-1}\,dz\)</span>.
and where <span class="math">\(C\)</span> and <span class="math">\(C'\)</span> are any circles with the origin as centre. Taking <span class="math">\(C\)</span> to be the circle of radius unity, and writing <span class="math">\(z = e^{i\theta}\)</span>, we have
<span class="math">\[a_n = \frac{1}{2\pi i}\!\int_0^{2\pi}\! e^{i\sin\theta}\, e^{-n\theta}i \,d\theta = \frac{1}{2\pi}\!\int_0^{2\pi}\! \cos(n\theta-x \sin\theta)\,d\theta, \]</span>
since <span class="math">\( \int_0^{2\pi}\! \cos(n\theta-x \sin\theta)\,d\theta\)</span> vanishes, as may be seen by writing <span class="math">\(2\pi-\phi\)</span> for <span class="math">\(\theta\)</span>. Thus <span class="math">\(a_n=J_n(x)\)</span>, and <span class="math">\(b_n=(-1)^n J_n(x)\)</span> since the function expanded is unaltered if <span class="math">\(- z^{-1}\)</span> be written
for <span class="math">\(z\)</span>, so that <span class="math">\(b_n =(-1)^n J_n(x)\)</span>, and the proof is complete.] </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Example</em> 2. Shew that, in the annulus defined by <span class="math">\(\left|\,a\,\right| < \left|\,z\,\right| < \left|\,b\,\right|\)</span>, the function
<span class="math">\[\left\{\frac{bz}{(z-a)(b-z)}\right\}^{\frac{1}{2}}\]</span>
can be expanded in the form
<span class="math">\[S_0+\sum_{n-1}^\infty S_n \left(\frac{a^n}{z^n}+ \frac{z^n}{b^n} \right),\]</span>
where <span class="math">\[S_n=\sum_{l=0}^\infty \frac{1 \cdot 3 \cdots (2l-1)\cdot 1 \cdot 3 \cdots (2l+2n-1)}{2^{2l+n}\, l! \,(l+n)!} \left(\frac{a}{b}\right)^l.\]</span> </p>

<p>The function is one-valued and analytic in the annulus (see <a href="CMA05-6-ManyValuedFunctions.html#5.7manyvaluedfunctions.">§5.7</a>), for the branch-points <span class="math">\(0\)</span>, <span class="math">\(a\)</span> neutralise each other, and so, by Laurent&#8217;s Theorem, if <span class="math">\(C\)</span> denote the circle <span class="math">\(\left|\, z \,\right|=r\)</span>, where <span class="math">\(\left|\, a\,\right| < r < \left|\, b\, \right|\)</span>, the coefficient of <span class="math">\(z^n\)</span> in the required expansion is
<span class="math">\[\frac{1}{2\pi i}\! \int_C \frac{dz}{z^{n+1}}\left\{\frac{bz}{(z-a)(b-z)}\right\}^{\frac{1}{2}}. \]</span> </p>

<p>Putting <span class="math">\(z = re^{i\theta}\)</span>, this becomes
<span class="math">\[\frac{1}{2\pi}\!\int_0^{2\pi} \! e^{-ni\theta}r^{-n}\,d\theta \, \left(1-\frac{r}{b}e^{i\theta}\right)^{-\frac{1}{2}}\left(1-\frac{a}{r}e^{-i\theta}\right)^{-\frac{1}{2}},\]</span> or
<span class="math">\[\frac{1}{2\pi}\!\int_0^{2\pi} \! e^{-ni\theta}r^{-n}\,d\theta \,\sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{1 \cdot 3 \cdots (2k-1)}{2^k \, k!}\frac{r^k e^{k i \theta}}{b^k}\sum_{l=0}^\infty \frac{1 \cdot 3 \cdots (2l-1)}{2^l \, l!}\frac{a^l e^{-l i \theta}}{r^l},\]</span>
the series being absolutely convergent and uniformly convergent with regard to <span class="math">\(\theta\)</span>.</p>

<p>The only terms which give integrals different from zero are those for which <span class="math">\(k = l + n\)</span>. So the coefficient of <span class="math">\(z^n\)</span> is
<span class="math">\[\frac{1}{2\pi}\!\int_0^{2\pi} \! d\theta \, \sum_{l=0}^\infty \frac{1 \cdot 3 \cdots (2l-1)}{2^l\, l!} \frac{1 \cdot 3 \cdots (2l+2n-1)}{2^{l+n}\, (l+n)!} \frac{a^l}{b^{l+n}} = \frac{S_n}{b^n},\]</span>
Similarly it can be shewn that the coefficient of <span class="math">\(\dfrac{1}{z^n}\)</span> is <span class="math">\(S_n a^n\)</span>. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Example</em> 3. Shew that
<span class="math">\[e^{uz+v/z} = a_0+a_1z+a_2z^2+ \cdots + \frac{b_1}{z}+\frac{b_2}{z^2}+ \cdots ,\]</span>
where
<span class="math">\[a_n = \frac{1}{2\pi}\! \int_0^{2\pi} \! e^{(u+v)\cos\theta} \cos \{(u-v)\sin \theta -n\theta\} \, d\theta,\]</span>
and
<span class="math">\[b_n = \frac{1}{2\pi}\! \int _0^{2\pi}\! e^{(u+v)\cos\theta} \cos \{(v-u)\sin \theta -n\theta\} \, d\theta.\]</span></p>

<h4 id="5.61thenatureofthesingularitiesofone-valuedfunctions.">5.61 The nature of the singularities of one-valued functions.</h4>

<p>Consider first a function <span class="math">\(f(z)\)</span> which is analytic throughout a closed
region <span class="math">\(S\)</span>, except at a single point a inside the region. </p>

<p>Let it be possible to define a function <span class="math">\(\phi(z)\)</span> such that </p>
<div class="listroman">

<ol>
<li><span class="math">\(\phi(z)\)</span> is analytic throughout <span class="math">\(S\)</span>,</li>
<li>when <span class="math">\(z\neq a\)</span>, <span class="math">\( f (z) = \phi(z) + \frac{B_1}{z-a} + \frac{B_2}{(z-a)^2}+ \cdots  + \frac{B_n}{(z-a)^n}.\)</span></li>
</ol>
</div>

<p>Then <span class="math">\(f(z)\)</span> is said to have a <em>&#8216;pole of order <span class="math">\(n\)</span> at <span class="math">\(a\)</span>&#8217;</em>; and the terms <span class="math">\(\frac{B_1}{z-a} + \frac{B_2}{(z-a)^2}+ \cdots  + \frac{B_n}{(z-a)^n}.\)</span> are called the <em>principal part of</em> <span class="math">\(f(z)\)</span> near <span class="math">\(a\)</span>.
By the definition of a singularity (<a href="CMA05-1-AnalyticFunctions.html#5.12cauchysdefinitionofananalyticfunctionofacomplexvariable.">§5.12</a>) a pole is a singularity. If <span class="math">\(n = 1\)</span>,
the singularity is called a <em>simple</em> pole. </p>

<p>Any singularity of a one-valued function other than a pole is called an
<em>essential singularity</em>. </p>

<p>If the essential singularity, <span class="math">\(a\)</span>, is isolated (i.e. if a region, of which <span class="math">\(a\)</span> is an interior point, can be found containing no singularities other than <span class="math">\(a\)</span>), then a Laurent expansion can be found, in ascending and descending powers of a valid when <span class="math">\(\Delta > \left|\, z - a\, \right| > \delta\)</span>, where <span class="math">\(\Delta\)</span> depends on the other singularities of the
function, and <span class="math">\(\delta\)</span> is arbitrarily small. Hence the &#8216;principal part&#8217; of a function near an isolated essential singularity consists of an infinite series. </p>

<p>It should be noted that a pole is, by definition, an isolated singularity, so
that all singularities which are not isolated (e.g. the limiting point of a
sequence of poles) are essential singularities. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>There does not exist, in general, an expansion of a function valid near a non-isolated singularity in the way that Laurent&#8217;s expansion is valid near an isolated singularity. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Corollary</em>. If <span class="math">\(f(z)\)</span> has a pole of order <span class="math">\(n\)</span> at <span class="math">\(a\)</span>, and <span class="math">\(\psi(z) = (z-a)^n f(z)\)</span> <span class="math">\((z \neq a)\)</span>,
<span class="math">\(\psi(a) = \lim\limits_{z \rightarrow 0}\, (z - a)^n f(z)\)</span>, then <span class="math">\(\psi(z)\)</span> is analytic at <span class="math">\(a\)</span>. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Example</em> 1. A function is not bounded near an isolated essential singularity.</p>

<p>[Prove that if the function were bounded near <span class="math">\(z = a\)</span>, the coefficients of negative powers of <span class="math">\(z - a\)</span> would all vanish.] </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Example</em> 2. Find the singularities of the function <span class="math">\(\displaystyle \left.e^{\,\left.e \middle/(z-a)\right.}\middle/\{e^{\,\left.z \middle/a\right.}-1\}\right.\)</span>. </p>

<p>At <span class="math">\(z = 0\)</span>, the numerator is analytic, and the denominator has a simple zero. Hence the function has a simple pole at <span class="math">\(z=0\)</span>. </p>

<p>Similarly there is a simple pole at each of the points <span class="math">\(2n\pi ia\)</span> <span class="math">\((n= \pm 1,\, \pm 2,\, \pm 3, \dots )\)</span>; the denominator is analytic and does not vanish for other values of <span class="math">\(z\)</span>. </p>

<p>At <span class="math">\(z = a\)</span>, the numerator has an isolated singularity, so Laurent&#8217;s Theorem is applicable, and the coefficients in the Laurent expansion may be obtained from the quotient
<span class="math">\[\frac{1+\dfrac{e}{z-a}+\dfrac{e^2}{2!(z-a)^2}+ \cdots }{e \left(1+\dfrac{z-a}{a}+\cdots\right)-1},\]</span>
which gives an expansion involving all positive and negative powers of <span class="math">\((z - a)\)</span>. So there is
an essential singularity at <span class="math">\(z = a\)</span>. </p>

<h4 id="5.62thepointatinfinity.">5.62 The &#8216;point at infinity.&#8217;</h4>

<p>The behaviour of a function <span class="math">\(f(z)\)</span> as <span class="math">\(\left|\, z\, \right| \rightarrow \infty\)</span> can be treated in a similar way to its behaviour as <span class="math">\(z\)</span> tends to a finite limit. </p>

<p>If we write <span class="math">\(z = \dfrac{1}{z'}\)</span>, so that large values of <span class="math">\(z\)</span> are represented by small values of <span class="math">\(z'\)</span> in the <span class="math">\(z'\)</span>-plane, there is a one-one correspondence between <span class="math">\(z\)</span> and <span class="math">\(z'\)</span>, provided that neither is zero; and to make the correspondence
complete it is sometimes convenient to say that when <span class="math">\(z'\)</span> is the origin, <span class="math">\(z\)</span> is the &#8216;point at infinity.&#8217; But the reader must be careful to observe that this is <em>not</em> a definite point, and any proposition about it is really a proposition
concerning the point <span class="math">\(z' = 0\)</span>. </p>

<p>Let <span class="math">\(f(z) = \phi(z')\)</span>. Then <span class="math">\(\phi(z')\)</span> is not defined at <span class="math">\(z' = 0\)</span>, but its behaviour near <span class="math">\(z' =0\)</span> is determined by its Taylor (or Laurent) expansion in powers of <span class="math">\(z'\)</span>; and we define <span class="math">\(\phi(0)\)</span> as <span class="math">\(\lim_{\:\!z' \rightarrow 0} \phi(z')\)</span> if that limit exists. For instance the function <span class="math">\(\phi(z')\)</span> may have a zero of order <span class="math">\(m\)</span> at the point <span class="math">\(z' = 0\)</span>; in this
case the Taylor expansion of <span class="math">\(\phi(z')\)</span> will be of the form
<span class="math">\[Az'^m+ Bz'^{m+1}+C z'^{m+2} + \cdots ,\]</span>
and so the expansion of <span class="math">\(f(z)\)</span> valid for sufficiently large values of <span class="math">\(\left|\, z\, \right|\)</span> will be of the form
<span class="math">\[f(z)= \frac{A}{z^m}+\frac{B}{z^{m+1}}+\frac{C}{z^{m+2}}+ \cdots .\]</span>
In this case, <span class="math">\(f(z)\)</span> is said to have a <em>zero of order <span class="math">\(m\)</span> at &#8216;infinity&#8217;.</em> </p>

<p>Again, the function <span class="math">\(\phi(z)\)</span> may have a pole of order <span class="math">\(m\)</span> at the point <span class="math">\(z' = 0\)</span>; in this case
<span class="math">\[\phi(z') =  \frac{A}{z'^m}+\frac{B}{z'^{m-1}}+\frac{C}{z'^{m-2}}+ \cdots \frac{L}{z'}+M+Nz'+Pz'^2+ \cdots ,\]</span>
and so, for sufficiently large values of <span class="math">\(\left|\, z\, \right|\)</span>, <span class="math">\(f(z)\)</span> can be expanded in the form
<span class="math">\[f(z) = Az^m+ Bz^{m-1}+C z^{m-2} + \cdots Lz+ M+ \frac{N}{z}+\frac{P}{z^2}+ \cdots.\]</span>
In this case, <span class="math">\(f(z)\)</span> is said to have a <em>pole of order <span class="math">\(m\)</span> at &#8216;infinity&#8217;.</em></p>

<p>Similarly <span class="math">\(f(z)\)</span> is said to have an <em>essential singularity</em> at infinity, if <span class="math">\(\phi(z')\)</span> has an essential singularity at the point <span class="math">\(z' = 0\)</span>. Thus the function <span class="math">\(e^z\)</span> has an essential singularity at infinity, since the function <span class="math">\(e^{\left.1\middle/z'\right.}\)</span> or
<span class="math">\[1+\frac{1}{z'}+\frac{1}{2!z'^2} + \frac{1}{3!z'^3}+\cdots\]</span>
has an essential singularity at <span class="math">\(z' = 0\)</span>. </p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Example</em>. Discuss the function represented by the series
<span class="math">\[\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{1}{n!} \frac{1}{1+\alpha^{2n}z^2},\qquad (\alpha > 1).\]</span>
The function represented by this series has singularities at <span class="math">\(z = \dfrac{i}{\alpha^n}\)</span> and <span class="math">\(z = -\dfrac{i}{\alpha^n}\)</span>,
<span class="math">\((n = 1,\, 2,\, 3, \dots)\)</span>, since at each of these points the denominator of one of the terms in the series is zero. These singularities are on the imaginary axis, and have <span class="math">\(z=0\)</span> as a limiting point; so no Taylor or Laurent expansion can be formed for the function valid throughout any region of which the origin is an interior point. </p>

<p>For values of <span class="math">\(z\)</span>, other than these singularities, the series converges absolutely, since the limit of the ratio of the <span class="math">\((n + 1)\)</span>th term to the <span class="math">\(n\)</span>th is <span class="math">\(\lim\limits_{n \rightarrow 0} (n+ 1)^{-1} \alpha^{-2} = 0\)</span>. The function is an even function of <span class="math">\(z\)</span> (i.e. is unchanged if the sign of <span class="math">\(z\)</span> be changed), tends to zero as
<span class="math">\(\left|\,z\,\right| \rightarrow \infty\)</span>, and is analytic on and outside a circle <span class="math">\(C\)</span> of radius greater than unity and centre at the origin. So, for points outside this circle, it can be expanded in the form
<span class="math">\[\frac{b_2}{z^2}+\frac{b_4}{z^4}+\frac{b_6}{z^6}+ \cdots ,\]</span>
where, by Laurent&#8217;s Theorem,
<span class="math">\[b_{2k}=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\!\int_C \! z^{2k-1} \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{1}{n!}\,\frac{\alpha^{-2n}}{\alpha^{-2n}+z^2} \,dz. \]</span>
Now
<span class="math">\[\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{\alpha^{-2n}z^{2k-1}}{n!\,(a^{-2n}+z^2)}=\sum_{n=0}^\infty \sum_{m=0}^\infty \frac{z^{2k-3}\alpha^{-2n}}{n!}(-1)^m\alpha^{-2nm}z^{-2m}.\]</span></p>

<p>This double series converges absolutely when <span class="math">\(\left|\,z\,\right| > 1\)</span>,<a href="#fn:4" id="fnref:4" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[4]</a> and if it be rearranged in powers of <span class="math">\(z\)</span> it converges uniformly.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Since the coefficient of <span class="math">\(z^{-1}\)</span> is <span class="math">\(\sum\limits_{n=0}^\infty\dfrac{(-1)^{k-1}\alpha^{-2kn}}{n!}\)</span>; and the only term which furnishes a non-zero integral is the term in <span class="math">\(z^{-1}\)</span>, we have
<span class="math">\[\begin{align*}
b_{2k} &= \frac{1}{2\pi i}\!\int_C \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^{k-1} \alpha^{-2kn}}{n!} \frac{dz}{z}\\
\\ &= \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^{k-1}}{n!\,\alpha^{2kn}}\\
\\ &= (-1)^{k-1}\frac{1}{e^{\alpha^{2k}}}.

<p>Therefore, when <span class="math">\(\left|\, z\, \right| > 1\)</span>, the function can be expanded in the form

<p>The function has a zero of the second order at infinity, since the expansion begins with a term in <span class="math">\( z^{-2}\)</span>. </p>

<h4 id="5.64functionswithnoessentialsingularities.">5.64 Functions with no essential singularities.</h4>

<p>We shall now shew that <em>the only one-valued functions which have no
singularities, except poles, at any point (including <span class="math">\(\infty\)</span>) are rational functions.</em></p>

<p>For let <span class="math">\(f(z)\)</span> be such a function; let its singularities in the finite part
of the plane be at the points <span class="math">\(c_1,\,\)</span><span class="math">\(c_2,  \cdots, \,c_k\)</span>;<a href="#fn:6" id="fnref:6" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[6]</a> and let the principal part (<a href="#5.61thenatureofthesingularitiesofone-valuedfunctions.">§5.61</a>)
of its expansion at the pole <span class="math">\(c_r\)</span> be
<span class="math">\[\frac{\alpha_{r,1}}{z-c_r}+\frac{\alpha_{r,2}}{(z-c_r)^2}+ \cdots + \frac{\alpha_{r,n_r}}{(z-c_r)^{n_r}}.\]</span></p>

<p>Let the principal part of its expansion at the pole at infinity be
<span class="math">\[\alpha_1 z+ \alpha_2 z^2 + \cdots + \alpha_n z^n;\]</span>
if there is not a pole at infinity, then all the coefficients in this expansion will be zero. </p>

<p>Now the function
<span class="math">\[f(z)-\sum_{r=1}^k \left\{\frac{\alpha_{r,1}}{z-c_r}+\frac{\alpha_{r,2}}{(z-c_r)^2}+ \cdots + \frac{\alpha_{r,n_r}}{(z-c_r)^{n_r}}\right\}-\alpha_1 z- \alpha_2 z^2 - \cdots - \alpha_n z^n\]</span></p>

<p>has clearly no singularities at the points <span class="math">\(c_1,\,\)</span><span class="math">\(c_2,  \cdots, \,c_k\)</span>, or at infinity; it is therefore analytic everywhere and is bounded as <span class="math">\(\left|\,z \, \right| \rightarrow \infty\)</span>, and so, by
Liouville&#8217;s Theorem, is a constant; that is,
<span class="math">\[f(z)=C+\alpha_1 z+ \alpha_2 z^2 + \cdots + \alpha_n z^n+\sum_{r=1}^k \left\{\frac{\alpha_{r,1}}{z-c_r}+\frac{\alpha_{r,2}}{(z-c_r)^2}+ \cdots + \frac{\alpha_{r,n_r}}{(z-c_r)^{n_r}}\right\},\]</span>
where <span class="math">\(C\)</span> is constant; <span class="math">\(f(z)\)</span> is therefore a rational function, and the theorem is established. </p>

<p>It is evident from Liouville&#8217;s theorem (combined with <a href="CMA03-3-Heine-Borel.html#continuousisbounded">§3.61 corollary (ii)</a>)
that a function which is analytic everywhere (including <span class="math">\(\infty\)</span>) is merely a constant. Functions which are analytic everywhere <em>except</em> at <span class="math">\(\infty\)</span> are of considerable importance; they are known as <em>integral functions.</em><a href="#fn:7" id="fnref:7" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[7]</a> Examples of such functions are <span class="math">\(e^z\)</span>, <span class="math">\(\sin z\)</span>, <span class="math">\(e^{ e^{\large {z}}}\)</span>. From <a href="CMA05-3-TaylorsTheorem.html#5.4taylorstheorem.">§5.4</a> it is apparent that there is no finite radius of convergence of a Taylor&#8217;s series which represents an integral function; and from the result of this section it is evident that all integral functions (except mere polynomials) have essential singularities at <span class="math">\(\infty\)</span>. </p>
