<h3 id="effectofchangingtheorderoftermsinaseries">2.4 Effect of Changing the Order of Terms in a Series</h3>

<p>In an ordinary sum the order of the terms is of no importance, for it can be varied without affecting the result of the addition. In an infinite series, however, this is no longer the case<a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[1]</a>, as will appear from the following example.</p>

<p>Let
<span class="math">\[\textstyle \sum = 1+\frac{1}{3}-\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{5}+\frac{1}{7}-\frac{1}{4}+\frac{1}{9}+\frac{1}{11}-\frac{1}{6}+ \dots\]</span>
and
<span class="math">\[\textstyle S = 1-\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{3}-\frac{1}{4}+\frac{1}{5}-\frac{1}{6}+\frac{1}{7}-\frac{1}{8}+ \dots\]</span>
and let <span class="math">\(\sum_n\)</span> and <span class="math">\(S_n\)</span> denote the sums of their first <span class="math">\(n\)</span> terms. These infinite series are formed of the same terms, but the order of the terms is different, and so <span class="math">\(\sum_n\)</span> and <span class="math">\(S_n\)</span> are quite distinct functions of <span class="math">\(n\)</span>.</p>

<p>Let
<span class="math">\[\sigma_n= \frac{1}{1}+\frac{1}{2}+ \dots +\frac{1}{n}, \textrm{ so that }\, S_{2n}=\sigma_{\,2n}-\sigma_n\]</span>
and
<span class="math">\[
\begin{align*}
\textstyle \sum_{3n}&=\frac{1}{1}+\frac{1}{3}+ \dots +\frac{1}{4n-1}-\frac{1}{2}-\frac{1}{4}-\dots-\frac{1}{2n} \\
    &=\sigma_{\,4n}-\frac{1}{2}\sigma_{\,2n}-\frac{1}{2}\sigma_{n} \\
    &=(\sigma_{\,4n}-\sigma_{\,2n})+\frac{1}{2} (\sigma_{\,2n}-\sigma_n) \\
    &=S_{4n} + \frac{1}{2}S_{2n}.
\end{align*}
\]</span></p>

<p>Making <span class="math">\(n \rightarrow \infty\)</span>, we see that
<span class="math">\[\textstyle \sum=S+\frac{1}{2}S ; \]</span>
and so the derangement of the terms of <span class="math">\(S\)</span> has altered is sum.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Example</em>. If in the series
<span class="math">\[1-\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{3}-\frac{1}{4} + \dots \]</span>
the order of the terms be altered, so that the ratio of the positive terms to the negative terms in the first <span class="math">\(n\)</span> terms is ultimately <span class="math">\(a^2\)</span>, shew that the sum of the series will become <span class="math">\(\log(2a)\)</span>. (Manning.)</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="thefundamentalpropertyofabsolutelyconvergentseries">2.41 The fundamental property of absolutely convergent series</h4>

<p>We shall shew that the sum of an absolutely convergent series is <em>not</em> affected by changing the order in which the terms occur.</p>

<p>Let
<span class="math">\[S=u_1+u_2+u_3+ \dots\]</span>
be an absolutely convergent series, and let <span class="math">\(S'\)</span> be a series formed by the same terms in a different order.</p>

<p>Let <span class="math">\(\epsilon\)</span> be an arbitrary positive number, and let <span class="math">\(n\)</span> be chosen so that
<span class="math">\[ \left|u_{n+1}\right|+\left|u_{n+2}\right|+\dots +\left|u_{n+p}\right| < \frac{1}{2}\epsilon\]</span>
for all values of <span class="math">\(p\)</span>.</p>

<p>Suppose that in order to obtain the first <span class="math">\(n\)</span> terms of <span class="math">\(S\)</span> we have to take <span class="math">\(m\)</span> terms of <span class="math">\(S'\)</span>; then if <span class="math">\(k>m\)</span>,
so that
<span class="math">\[S_k\!'=S_n + \textrm{ terms of }S\textrm{ with indices greater than n,}\]</span>
so that
<span class="math">\[S_k\!'-S=S_n-S + \textrm{ terms of }S\textrm{ with indices greater than n,}\]</span></p>

<p>Now the modulus of the sum of any number of terms of <span class="math">\(S\)</span> with indices greater than <span class="math">\(n\)</span> does not exceed the sum of their moduli, and therefore is less
than <span class="math">\( \frac{1}{2}\epsilon \)</span>.</p>

<p>Therefore
<span class="math">\[\left|\,S_k\!'-S\,\right| < \left|\,S_n-S\,\right| + \frac{1}{2}\epsilon .\]</span>
But
<span class="math">\[
\begin{align*}
 \left|\,S_n-S\,\right| &\leq \lim_{p \rightarrow \infty} \{ \left|\,u_{n+1}\,\right|+\left|\,u_{n+2}\,\right|+\dots +\left|\,u_{n+p}\,\right| \} \\
   &\leq  \frac{1}{2}\epsilon .
\end{align*}
\]</span>
Therefore given <span class="math">\(\epsilon\)</span> we can find <span class="math">\(m\)</span> such that
<span class="math">\[\left|\,S_k\!'-S\,\right| < \epsilon \]</span>
when <span class="math">\(k > m\)</span>; therefore <span class="math">\(S_m\!' \rightarrow S\)</span>, which is the required result.</p>

<p>If a series of real terms converges, but not absolutely, and if <span class="math">\(S_p\)</span> be the sum of the first <span class="math">\(p\)</span> positive terms, and if <span class="math">\(\sigma_n\)</span> be the sum of the first <span class="math">\(n\)</span> negative terms, then <span class="math">\(S_p \rightarrow \infty,\, \sigma_n \rightarrow \infty\)</span>; and <span class="math">\(\lim (S_p +\sigma_n)\)</span> does not exist unless we are given some relation between <span class="math">\(p\)</span> and <span class="math">\(n\)</span>. It has, in fact, been shewn by Riemann that it is possible, by choosing a suitable relation, to make <span class="math">\(\lim (S_p +\sigma_n)\)</span> equal to <em>any</em> given real number<a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[2]</a>.</p>

<h3 id="doubleseries">2.5 Double series<a href="#fn:3" id="fnref:3" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[3]</a></h3>

<p>Let <span class="math">\(u_{m,n}\)</span> be a number determinate for all positive integral values of <span class="math">\(m\)</span> and <span class="math">\(n\)</span>; consider the array
<span class="math">\[
\begin{array}{cccc}
u_{1,1}&u_{1,2}&u_{1,3}& \cdots \\
u_{2,1}&u_{2,2}&u_{2,3}& \cdots \\
u_{3,1}&u_{3,2}&u_{3,3}& \cdots \\
\vdots&\vdots&\vdots&\ddots
\end{array}
\]</span>
Let the sum of the terms inside the rectangle, formed by the first
<span class="math">\(m\)</span> rows of the first <span class="math">\(n\)</span> columns of this array of terms, be denoted by <span class="math">\(S_{m,n}\)</span>. </p>

<p>If a number <span class="math">\(S\)</span> exists such that, given any arbitrary positive number <span class="math">\(\epsilon\)</span>, it is possible to find integers <span class="math">\(m\)</span> and <span class="math">\(n\)</span> such that
<span class="math">\[\left|\,S_{\mu, \nu}-S\,\right| < \epsilon\]</span>
whenever both <span class="math">\(\mu > m\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\nu > n\)</span>, we say<a href="#fn:4" id="fnref:4" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[4]</a> that the <em>double series of which the
general element is <span class="math">\(u_{\mu, \nu}\)</span> converges to the sum <span class="math">\(S\)</span></em>, and we write
<span class="math">\[\lim_{\mu \rightarrow \infty,\, \nu \rightarrow \infty}S_{\mu, \nu}=S . \]</span></p>

<p>If the double series, of which the general element is <span class="math">\(\left|u_{\mu, \nu}\right|\)</span>, is convergent, we say that the given double series is <em>absolutely convergent</em>.</p>

<p>Since <span class="math">\(u_{\mu, \nu}=(S_{\mu, \nu}-S_{\mu, \nu-1})-(S_{\mu-1, \nu}-S_{\mu-1, \nu-1}) \)</span>, it is easily seen that, if
the double series is convergent, then
<span class="math">\[\lim_{\mu \rightarrow \infty,\, \nu \rightarrow \infty}u_{\mu, \nu}=0 . \]</span></p>

<p><em>Stolz&#8217; necessary and sufficient condition for convergence</em>.<a href="#fn:5" id="fnref:5" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[5]</a> A condition for convergence which is obviously necessary (see <a href="CMA02-1-Limits.html#cauchy">§2.22</a>) is that, given <span class="math">\(\epsilon\)</span>, we can find <span class="math">\(m\)</span> and <span class="math">\(n\)</span> such that <span class="math">\(\left|S_{\mu+\rho, \nu+\sigma}-S_{\mu, \nu}\right| < \epsilon\)</span> whenever <span class="math">\(\mu > m\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\nu > n\)</span> and
<span class="math">\(\rho,\sigma\)</span> may take any of the values <span class="math">\(0, 1, 2, \dots\)</span>. The condition is also sufficient; for, suppose it satisfied; then, when <span class="math">\(\mu>m+n\)</span>, <span class="math">\[ \left|\,S_{\mu+\rho, \mu+\rho}-S_{\mu, \mu}\,\right| < \epsilon .\]</span>
Therefore, by <a href="CMA02-1-Limits.html#cauchy">§2.22</a>, <span class="math">\(S_{u,u}\)</span> has a limit <span class="math">\(S\)</span>; and then making <span class="math">\(\rho\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\sigma\)</span> tend to infinity in such a way that <span class="math">\(\mu+\rho=\nu+\sigma\)</span>, we see that <span class="math">\(\left|\,S_{\mu, \nu}-S\,\right| < \epsilon\)</span> whenever <span class="math">\(\mu > m\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\nu > n\)</span>; that is to say, the double series converges.<a href="#fn:6" id="fnref:6" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[6]</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Corollary</em>. An absolutely convergent double series is convergent. For if the double series converges absolutely and if <span class="math">\(t_{\, m,n}\)</span> be the sum of <span class="math">\(m\)</span> rows of <span class="math">\(n\)</span> columns of the series of moduli, then, given <span class="math">\(\epsilon\)</span>, we can find <span class="math">\(\mu\)</span> such that, when <span class="math">\(p>m>\mu\)</span> and <span class="math">\(q>n>\mu\)</span>, <span class="math">\(t_{\, p,q}-t_{\, m,n} < \epsilon\)</span>. But <span class="math">\(\left|\,S_{p,q}-S_{m,n}\,\right| \leq  t_{\, p,q}-t_{\, m,n} \)</span> and so <span class="math">\(\left|\,S_{p,q}-S_{m,n}\,\right| < \epsilon\)</span> when <span class="math">\(p>m>\mu\)</span>, <span class="math">\(q>n>\mu\)</span>; and this is the condition that the double series should converge. </p>

<h4 id="methodsofsummingdoubleseries">2.51 Methods of summing double series<a href="#fn:7" id="fnref:7" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[7]</a></h4>

<p>Let us suppose that <span class="math">\(\sum\limits_{\nu=1}^{\infty} u_{\mu,\nu}\)</span>, converges to the sum <span class="math">\(S_{\mu}\)</span>. Then <span class="math">\(\sum\limits_{\nu=1}^{\infty} S_{\mu}\)</span> is called the <em>sum by rows</em> of the double series; that is to say, the sum by rows is <span class="math">\(\sum\limits_{\mu=1}^{\infty} \left(\sum\limits_{\nu=1}^{\infty} u_{\mu,\nu} \right)\)</span>. Similarly, the sum by columns is defined as <span class="math">\(\sum\limits_{\nu=1}^{\infty} \left(\sum\limits_{\mu=1}^{\infty} u_{\mu,\nu} \right)\)</span>.
That these two sums are not necessarily the same is shewn by the example
<span class="math">\[S_{\mu, \nu}= \frac{\mu-\nu}{\mu+\nu},\]</span>
in which the sum by rows is <span class="math">\(-1\)</span>, the sum by columns is <span class="math">\(+1\)</span>; and <span class="math">\(S\)</span> does not exist. </p>

<p><strong><em>PRINGSHEIM&#8217;S THEOREM</em></strong>: <em>If <span class="math">\(S\)</span> exists and the sums by rows and columns exist, then each of these sums is equal to <span class="math">\(S\)</span>.</em><a href="#fn:8" id="fnref:8" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[8]</a></p>

<p>For since <span class="math">\(S\)</span> exists, then we can find <span class="math">\(m\)</span> such that
<span class="math">\[\left|\,S_{\mu,\nu}-S\,\right| < \epsilon, \textrm{ if } \mu>m, \, \nu>m .\]</span>
And therefore, since <span class="math">\(\lim\limits_{\nu \rightarrow \infty} S_{\mu,\nu}\)</span> exists, <span class="math">\(\left|\, (\lim\limits_{\nu \rightarrow \infty} S_{\mu,\nu})-S \,\right| \leq \epsilon\)</span>; that is to say,
<span class="math">\[ \left|\, \sum_{p=1}^{\mu} S_p - S\,\right| \leq \epsilon , \textrm{ when } \mu > m ,\]</span>
and so (<a href="CMA02-1-Limits.html#cauchy">§2.22</a>) the sum by rows converges to <span class="math">\(S\)</span>. In like manner, the sum by columns converges to <span class="math">\(S\)</span>.</p>

<h4 id="absolutelyconvergentdoubleseries">2.52 Absolutely convergent double series</h4>

<p>We can prove the analogue of <a href="#thefundamentalpropertyofabsolutelyconvergentseries">§2.41</a> for double series, namely that <em>if the terms of an absolutely convergent double series are taken in any order as a simple series, their sum tends to the same limit, provided that every term occurs in the summation.</em></p>

<p>Let <span class="math">\(\sigma_{\,\mu,\nu}\)</span> be the sum of the rectangle of <span class="math">\(\mu\)</span> rows and <span class="math">\(\nu\)</span> columns of the double series whose general element is <span class="math">\(\left|u_{\,\mu,\nu} \right|\)</span>; and let the sum of this double series be <span class="math">\(\sigma\)</span>.<a href="#fn:9" id="fnref:9" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[9]</a> Then given <span class="math">\(\epsilon\)</span>, we can find <span class="math">\(m\)</span> and <span class="math">\(n\)</span> such that <span class="math">\(\sigma - \sigma_{\,\mu,\nu} < \frac{1}{2}\epsilon\)</span> whenever both <span class="math">\(\mu>m\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\nu>n\)</span>. </p>

<p>Now suppose that it is necessary to take <span class="math">\(N\)</span> terms of the deranged series (in the order in which the terms are taken) in order to include all the terms of <span class="math">\(S_{M+1, M+1}\)</span>, and let the sum of these terms be <span class="math">\(t_{ N}\)</span>.</p>

<p>Then <span class="math">\(t_{N}-S_{M+1,M+1}\)</span> consists of a sum of terms of the type <span class="math">\(u_{p,q}\)</span> in which
<span class="math">\(p > m\)</span>, <span class="math">\( q >n\)</span> whenever <span class="math">\(M > m\)</span> and <span class="math">\(M > n\)</span>; and therefore
 <span class="math">\[\left|\,t_{ N}-S_{M+1,M+1}\,\right| \leq \sigma - \sigma_{\,M+1,M+1} <  \frac{1}{2}\epsilon .\]</span></p>

<p>Also, <span class="math">\(S-S_{M+1,M+1}\)</span> consists of terms <span class="math">\(u_{p,q}\)</span> in which <span class="math">\(p > m\)</span>, <span class="math">\( q >n\)</span>; therefore
<span class="math">\[\left|\,S-S_{M+1,M+1}\,\right| \leq \sigma - \sigma_{\,M+1,M+1} <  \frac{1}{2}\epsilon ;\]</span>
therefore <span class="math">\(\left|\,S-t_{n}\,\right| <\epsilon\)</span>; and, corresponding to any given number <span class="math">\(\epsilon\)</span>, we can find <span class="math">\(N\)</span>; and therefore <span class="math">\(t_{N} \rightarrow S\)</span>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Example</em> 1. Prove that in an absolutely convergent double series, <span class="math">\(\sum\limits_{n=1}^{\infty} u_{m,n}\)</span> exists, and thence that the sums by rows and columns respectively converge to <span class="math">\(S\)</span>.</p>

<p>[Let the sum of <span class="math">\(\mu\)</span> rows of <span class="math">\(\nu\)</span> columns of the series of moduli be <span class="math">\(t_{\mu,\nu}\)</span>, and let <span class="math">\(t\)</span> be the sum of the series of moduli. Then <span class="math">\(\sum\limits_{\nu=1}^{\infty} \left| \,u_{\mu,\nu}\,\right| < t\)</span>, and so <span class="math">\(\sum\limits_{\nu=1}^{\infty}  u_{\mu,\nu}\)</span> converges; let its sum be <span class="math">\(b_{\mu}\)</span>; then
<span class="math">\[\left|\, b_1 \,\right|+\left|\, b_2 \,\right|+ \dots +\left|\, b_{\mu}\, \right| \leq \lim_{\nu \rightarrow \infty} t_{\, \mu,\nu}\leq t ,\]</span>
and so <span class="math">\(\sum_{\mu=1}^{\infty} b_{\mu}\)</span> converges absolutely. Therefore the sum by rows of the double series exists, and similarly the sum by columns exists; and the required result then follows from Pringsheim&#8217;s theorem.] </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Example</em> 2. Shew from first principles that if the terms of an absolutely convergent double series be arranged in the order
<span class="math">\[u_{1,1}+(u_{2,1}+u_{1,2})+(u_{3,1}+u_{2,2}+u_{1,3})+(u_{4,1}+ \dots +u_{1,4})+ \dots ,\]</span>
this series converges to <span class="math">\(S\)</span>.</p>

<h4 id="cauchymultiplication">2.53 Cauchy&#8217;s theorem on the multiplication of absolutely convergent series<a href="#fn:10" id="fnref:10" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[10]</a></h4>

<p>We shall now shew that <em>if two series
<span class="math">\[S=u_1+u_2+u_3+ \dots \]</span>
and
<span class="math">\[T=v_1+v_2+v_3+ \dots \]</span>
are absolutely convergent, then the series
<span class="math">\[P=u_1v_1+u_2v_1+u_1v_2+ \dots ,\]</span>
formed by the products of their terms, written in any order, is absolutely convergent, and has for sum <span class="math">\(ST\)</span>.</em></p>

<p>Let
<span class="math">\[S_n=u_1+u_2+u_3+ \dots +u_n \]</span>
<span class="math">\[T_n=v_1+v_2+v_3+ \dots +v_n .\]</span>
Then
<span class="math">\[ST=\lim S_n \lim T_n=\lim(S_n T_n)\]</span>
by <a href="CMA02-1-Limits.html#monotonicex2">example 2 of §2.2</a>. Now
<span class="math">\[
\begin{array}{ccc}
S_nT_n=&&u_1v_1+u_2v_1+ \dots +u_nv_1 \\
           &+&u_1v_2+u_2v_2+ \dots +u_nv_2 \\
           &\vdots& \quad \vdots \\
          &+&u_1v_n+u_2v_n+ \dots +u_nv_n .\\
\end{array}
\]</span></p>

<p>But this double series is absolutely convergent; for if these terms are replaced by their moduli, the result is <span class="math">\(\sigma_n \tau_n\)</span>, where
<span class="math">\[\sigma_n= \left|u_1 \right|+ \left|u_2 \right|+ \dots +  \left|u_n \right|\]</span>
<span class="math">\[\tau_n= \left|v_1 \right|+ \left|v_2 \right|+ \dots +  \left|v_n \right|\]</span>
and <span class="math">\(\sigma_n \tau_n\)</span> is known to have a limit. Therefore, by <a href="#absolutelyconvergentdoubleseries">§2.52</a>, if the elements of
the double series, of which the general term is <span class="math">\(u_m v_n\)</span>, be taken in any order,
their sum converges to <span class="math">\(ST\)</span>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Example</em>. Shew that the series obtained by multiplying the two series

<span class="math">\[1+\frac{1}{z}+\frac{1}{z^2}+\frac{1}{z^3}+\frac{1}{z^4}+ \dots,\]</span>
and rearranging according to powers of <span class="math">\(z\)</span>, converges so long as the representative point of <span class="math">\(z\)</span> lies in the ring-shaped region bounded by the circles <span class="math">\(\left|\,z \,\right|=1\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\left|\,z \,\right|=2\)</span>. </p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="powerseries">2.6 Power-Series<a href="#fn:11" id="fnref:11" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[11]</a></h3>

<p>A series of the type
<span class="math">\[a_0+a_1z+a_2z^2+a_3z^3+ \dots ,\]</span>
in which the coefficients <span class="math">\(a_0,\, a_1,\, a_2,\, a_3, \dots\)</span> are independent of <span class="math">\(z\)</span>, is called a <em>series proceeding according to ascending powers of <span class="math">\(z\)</span></em>, or briefly a <em>power-series</em>. </p>

<p>We shall now shew that if a power-series converges for any value <span class="math">\(z_0\)</span> of <span class="math">\(z\)</span>, it will be absolutely convergent for all values of <span class="math">\(z\)</span> whose representative points are within a circle which passes through <span class="math">\(z_0\)</span> and has its centre at the origin. </p>

<p>For, if <span class="math">\(z\)</span> be such a point, we have <span class="math">\(\left|\,z \,\right|< \left|\,z_0 \,\right|\)</span>. Now, since <span class="math">\(\sum\limits_{n=0}^{\infty} a_n z_0^{\, n}\)</span> converges, <span class="math">\( a_n z_0^{\, n}\)</span> must tend to zero as <span class="math">\( n \rightarrow \infty \)</span>, and so we can find <span class="math">\(M\)</span> (independent of <span class="math">\(n\)</span>) such that
<span class="math">\[\left|\,a_n z_0^n \,\right| < M .\]</span>
Thus
<span class="math">\[\left|\,a_n z^n \,\right| < M\left|\frac{z}{z_0}\right|^n .\]</span></p>

<p>Therefore every term in the series <span class="math">\(\sum\limits_{n=0}^{\infty} a_n z^n\)</span> is less than the corresponding term in the convergent geometric series
<span class="math">\[\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}M\left|\frac{z}{z_0}\right|^n ;\]</span>
the series is therefore convergent; and so the power-series is <em>absolutely</em> convergent, as the series of moduli of its terms is a convergent series; the result stated is therefore established.</p>

<p>Let <span class="math">\(\varliminf \left|a_n \right|^{-1/n}=r\)</span>; then, from <a href="CMA02-2-Series.html#cauchystest">§2.35</a>,
<span class="math">\(\sum\limits_{n=0}^{\infty} a_n z^n\)</span> converges absolutely when <span class="math">\(\left|\,z\,\right|< r\)</span>; if <span class="math">\(\left|\,z\,\right|> r\)</span>, <span class="math">\(a_n z^n\)</span> does not tend to zero and so <span class="math">\(\sum\limits_{n=0}^{\infty} a_n z^n\)</span> diverges (<a href="CMA02-2-Series.html#convergenceofaninfiniteseries">§2.3</a>).
The circle <span class="math">\(\left|\,z\,\right|=r\)</span>, which includes all the values of <span class="math">\(z\)</span> for which the power-series
<span class="math">\[a_0+a_1z+a_2z^2+a_3z^3+ \dots \]</span>
converges<a href="#fn:12" id="fnref:12" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[12]</a>, is called the <em>circle of convergence</em> of the series. The radius of the circle is called the <em>radius of convergence</em>.</p>

<p>In practice there is usually a simpler way of finding <span class="math">\(r\)</span>, derived from d&#8217;Alembert&#8217;s test (<a href="CMA02-2-Series.html#ratiotest">§2.36</a>); <span class="math">\(r\)</span> is <span class="math">\(\lim (a_n /a_{n + 1})\)</span> if this limit exists. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>A power-series may converge for all values of the variable, as happens, for instance, in the case of the series<a href="#fn:13" id="fnref:13" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[13]</a>
<span class="math">\[z-\frac{z^3}{3!}+\frac{z^5}{5!}- \dots ,\]</span>
which represents the function <span class="math">\(\sin z\)</span>; in this case the series converges over the whole 2-plane. </p>

<p>On the other hand, the radius of convergence of a power-series may be zero; thus in the case of the series
<span class="math">\[1+1!\,z+2!\,z^2+3!\,z^3+ 4!\,z^4+ \dots \]</span>
we have
<span class="math">\[ \left|\frac{u_{n+1}}{u_n}\right|=n\left|\,z \,\right| ,\]</span>
which, for all values of <span class="math">\(n\)</span> after some fixed value, is greater than unity when <span class="math">\(z\)</span> has any value different from zero. The series converges therefore only at the point <span class="math">\(z = 0\)</span>, and the radius of its circle of convergence vanishes. </p>

<p>A power-series may or may not converge for points which are actually on the periphery of the circle; thus the series
<span class="math">\[1+\frac{z}{1^s}+\frac{z}{2^s}+\frac{z}{3^s}+\frac{z}{4^s}+ \dots ,\]</span>
whose radius of convergence is unity, converges or diverges at the point <span class="math">\(z = 1\)</span> according as <span class="math">\(s\)</span> is greater or not greater than unity, as was seen in <a href="CMA02-2-Series.html#geometricseries">§2.33</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Corollary. If <span class="math">\((a_n)\)</span> be a sequence of positive terms such that <span class="math">\(\lim(a_{n + 1} /a_n )\)</span> exists, this limit is equal to <span class="math">\(\varliminf a^{1/n}\)</span>. </p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="convergenceofseriesderivedfromapower-series">2.61 Convergence of series derived from a power-series</h4>

<p>Let
<span class="math">\[a_0 + a_1 z + a_2 z^2 + a_3 z^3 + a_4 z^4 + \dots \]</span>
be a power-series, and consider the series
<span class="math">\[a_1  + 2a_2 z + 3a_3 z^2 + 4a_4 z^3 + \dots ,\]</span>
which is obtained by differentiating the power-series term by term. We shall now shew that <em>the derived series has the same circle of convergence as the
original series.</em></p>

<p>For let <span class="math">\(z\)</span> be a point within the circle of convergence of the power-series; and choose a positive number <span class="math">\(r_1\)</span> intermediate in value between <span class="math">\(\left|\,z\,\right|\)</span> and <span class="math">\(r\)</span> the radius of convergence. Then, since the series <span class="math">\(\sum\limits_{n=0}^{\infty} a_n r_1^{\,n}\)</span> converges absolutely, its terms must tend to zero as <span class="math">\(n \rightarrow \infty\)</span>; and it must therefore be possible to find a positive number <span class="math">\(M\)</span>, independent of <span class="math">\(n\)</span>, such that <span class="math">\(\left|\,a_n \,\right| < Mr_1^{-n}\)</span> for all values of <span class="math">\(n\)</span>.</p>

<p>Then the terms of the series <span class="math">\(\sum\limits_{n=1}^{\infty} n\, \left|\,a_n \,\right| \left|\,z \,\right|^{n-1}\)</span> are less than the corresponding terms of the series
<span class="math">\[ \frac{M}{r_1}\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{n\, \left|\,z \,\right|^{n-1}}{r_1^{\,n-1}} .\]</span></p>

<p>But this series converges, by <a href="CMA02-2-Series.html#ratiotest">§2.36</a>,
since <span class="math">\(\left|\,z \,\right| < r_1\)</span>. Therefore, by <a href="CMA02-2-Series.html#thecomparisontheorem">§2.34</a>, the series
<span class="math">\[ \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} n\, \left|\,a_n \,\right| \left|\,z \,\right|^{n-1}\]</span>
converges; that is, the series <span class="math">\(\sum\limits_{n=1}^{\infty} n a_n z^{n-1}\)</span> converges absolutely for all points <span class="math">\(z\)</span> situated within the circle of convergence of the original series <span class="math">\(\sum\limits_{n=0}^{\infty} a_n z^{n}\)</span>. When <span class="math">\(\left|\,z \,\right|>r\)</span>, <span class="math">\(a_n z^n\)</span> does not tend to zero, and <em>a fortiori</em> <span class="math">\(na_n z^{n}\)</span> does not tend to zero; and so the two series have the same circle of convergence. </p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Corollary</em>. The series <span class="math">\(\sum\limits_{n=0}^{\infty}\displaystyle \frac{a_n z^{n+1}}{n+1}\)</span>, obtained by integrating the original power-series term by term, has the same circle of convergence as <span class="math">\(\sum\limits_{n=0}^{\infty} a_n z^{n}\)</span>.</p>

<p>We say that the series <span class="math">\(\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}v_n\)</span> consists of the terms of <span class="math">\(\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}u_n\)</span> in a different order if a law is given by which corresponding to each positive integer <span class="math">\(p\)</span> we can find one (and only one) integer <span class="math">\(q\)</span> and <em>visa versa</em>, and <span class="math">\(v_q\)</span> is taken equal to <span class="math">\(u_p\)</span>.
