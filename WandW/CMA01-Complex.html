<h3 id="rationalnumbers">1.1 Rational numbers</h3>

<p>The idea of a set of numbers is derived in the first instance from the consideration of the set of <em>positive</em><a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[1]</a> <em>integral numbers</em>, or <em>positive integers</em>; that is to say, the numbers <span class="math">\(1, 2, 3, 4,\dots\)</span>. Positive integers have many properties, which will be found in treatises on the Theory of Integral Numbers; but at a very early stage in the development of mathematics it was found that the operations of Subtraction and Division could only be performed among them subject to inconvenient restrictions; and consequently, in elementary Arithmetic, classes of numbers are constructed such that the operations of subtraction and division can always be performed among them.</p>

<p>To obtain a class of numbers among which the operation of subtraction can be performed without restraint we construct the class of <em>integers</em>, which consists of the class of positive<a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[2]</a> integers <span class="math">\((+1, +2, +3,\dots)\)</span> and of the class of negative integers <span class="math">\((-1, -2, -3,\dots)\)</span> and the number 0.</p>

<p>To obtain a class of numbers among which the operations both of subtraction and of division can be performed freely,<a href="#fn:3" id="fnref:3" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[3]</a> we construct the class of <em>rational numbers</em>. Symbols which denote members of this class are <span class="math">\(\frac{1}{2}, 3, 0, -\frac{15}{7}\)</span>.</p>

<p>We have thus introduced three classes of numbers, (i) the <em>signless integers</em>, (ii) the <em>integers</em>, (iii) the <em>rational numbers</em>.</p>

<p>It is not part of the scheme of this work to discuss the construction of the class of integers or the logical foundations of the theory of rational numbers.<a href="#fn:4" id="fnref:4" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[4]</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The extension of the idea of number, which has just been described, was not effected without some opposition from the more conservative mathematicians. In the latter half of the eighteenth century, Maseres (1731&#8211;1824) and Frend (1757&#8211;1841) published works on Algebra, Trigonometry, etc., in which the use of negative numbers was disallowed, although Descartes had used them unrestrictedly more than a hundred years before.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A rational number <span class="math">\(x\)</span> may be represented to the eye in the following manner:
If, on a straight line, we take an origin <span class="math">\(O\)</span> and a fixed segment <span class="math">\(OP_1\)</span> (<span class="math">\(P_1\)</span> being on the right of <span class="math">\(O\)</span>), we can measure from a length <span class="math">\(OP_x\)</span> such that the ratio <span class="math">\(\left. OP_x \middle/ OP_1 \right.\)</span> is equal to <span class="math">\(x\)</span>; the point <span class="math">\(P_x\)</span> is taken on the right or left of <span class="math">\(O\)</span> according as the number <span class="math">\(x\)</span> is positive or negative. We may regard either the <em>point</em> <span class="math">\(P_x\)</span> or the <em>displacement</em> <span class="math">\(OP_x\)</span> (which will be written <span class="math">\(\overline{OP}_x\)</span>) as representing the number <span class="math">\(x\)</span>.</p>

<p>All the rational numbers can thus be represented by points on the line, but the converse is not true. For if we measure off on the line a length <span class="math">\(OQ\)</span> equal to the diagonal of a square of which <span class="math">\(OP_1\)</span> is one side, it can be proved that <span class="math">\(Q\)</span> does not correspond to any rational number.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Points on the line which do not represent rational numbers may be said to represent irrational numbers; thus the point <span class="math">\(Q\)</span> is said to represent the irrational number <span class="math">\(\sqrt{2}=1.414213\dots\)</span>. But while such an explanation of the existence of irrational numbers satisfied the mathematicians of the eighteenth century and may still be sufficient for those whose interest lies in the applications of mathematics rather than in the logical upbuilding of the theory, yet from the logical standpoint it is improper to introduce geometrical intuitions to supply deficiencies in arithmetical arguments; and it was shewn by Dedekind in 1858 that the theory of irrational numbers can be established on a purely arithmetical basis without any appeal to geometry.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="dedekind">1.2 Dedekind&#8217;s theory of irrational numbers<a href="#fn:5" id="fnref:5" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[5]</a></h3>

<p>The geometrical property of points on a line which suggested the starting point of the arithmetical theory of irrationals was that, if all points of a line are separated into two classes such that every point of the first class is on the right of every point of the second class, there exists one and only one point at which the line is thus severed.</p>

<p>Following up this idea, Dedekind considered rules by which a separation<a href="#fn:6" id="fnref:6" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[6]</a> or <em>section</em> of <em>all</em> rational numbers into two classes can be made, these classes
(which will be called the <span class="math">\(L\)</span>-class and the <span class="math">\(R\)</span>-class, or the left class and the right class) being such that they possess the following properties:</p>
<div class="listroman">

<ol>
<li>At least one member of each class exists.</li>
<li>Every member of the <span class="math">\(L\)</span>-class is less than every member of the <span class="math">\(R\)</span>-class.</li>
</ol>
</div>

<p>It is obvious that such a section is made by any rational number <span class="math">\(x\)</span>; and <span class="math">\(x\)</span> is either the greatest number of the <span class="math">\(L\)</span>-class or the least number of the <span class="math">\(R\)</span>-class. But sections can be made in which no rational number <span class="math">\(x\)</span> plays this part. Thus, since there is no rational number<a href="#fn:7" id="fnref:7" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[7]</a> whose square is <span class="math">\(2\)</span>, it is easy to see that we may form a section in which the <span class="math">\(R\)</span>-class consists of the positive rational numbers whose squares exceed <span class="math">\(2\)</span>, and the <span class="math">\(L\)</span>-class consists of all other rational numbers.</p>

<p>Then this section is such that the <span class="math">\(R\)</span>-class has no least member and the <span class="math">\(L\)</span>-class has no greatest member; for, if <span class="math">\(x\)</span> be any positive rational fraction,
and <span class="math">\( \displaystyle \; y= \frac{x(x^2+6)}{3x^2+2} \)</span>,
then <span class="math">\( \displaystyle \; y-x= \frac{2x(2-x^2)}{3x^2+2} \)</span>
and <span class="math">\( \displaystyle \; y^2-2= \frac{x(x^2-2)^3}{(3x^2+2)^2}, \)</span>
so <span class="math">\(x^2\)</span>, <span class="math">\(y^2\)</span> and <span class="math">\(2\)</span> are in order of magnitude; and therefore given any member <span class="math">\(x\)</span> of the <span class="math">\(L\)</span>-class, we can always find a greater member of the <span class="math">\(L\)</span>-class, or given any member <span class="math">\(x' \)</span> of the <span class="math">\(R\)</span>-class, we can always find a smaller member of the <span class="math">\(R\)</span>-class, such numbers being, for instance, <span class="math">\(y\)</span> and <span class="math">\(y' \)</span>, where <span class="math">\(y' \)</span> is the same function of <span class="math">\(x' \)</span> as <span class="math">\(y\)</span> of <span class="math">\(x\)</span>.<a href="#fn:8" id="fnref:8" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[8]</a></p>

<p>If a section is made in which the <span class="math">\(R\)</span>-class has a least member <span class="math">\(A_2\)</span>, or if the <span class="math">\(L\)</span>-class has a greatest member <span class="math">\(A_1\)</span>, the section determines a <em>rational-real</em> number, which it is convenient to denote by the <em>same</em><a href="#fn:9" id="fnref:9" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[9]</a> symbol <span class="math">\(A_2\)</span> or <span class="math">\(A_1\)</span>.</p>

<p>If a section is made, such that the <span class="math">\(R\)</span>-class has no least member and the <span class="math">\(L\)</span>-class has no greatest member, <em>the section determines an irrational-real number</em>.<a href="#fn:10" id="fnref:10" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[10]</a></p>

<p>If <span class="math">\(x\)</span>, <span class="math">\(y\)</span> are real numbers (defined by sections) we say that <span class="math">\(x\)</span> is greater than <span class="math">\(y\)</span> if the <span class="math">\(L\)</span>-class defining <span class="math">\(x\)</span> contains at least two<a href="#fn:11" id="fnref:11" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[11]</a> members of the <span class="math">\(R\)</span>-class defining <span class="math">\(y\)</span>.</p>

<p>Let <span class="math">\(\alpha, \beta,\dots\)</span> be real numbers and let <span class="math">\(A_1, B_1,\dots\)</span> be any members of the corresponding <span class="math">\(L\)</span>-classes while <span class="math">\(A_2, B_2,\dots\)</span> are any members of the corresponding <span class="math">\(R\)</span>-classes. The classes of which <span class="math">\(A_1, A_2,\dots\)</span> are respectively members will be denoted by the symbols <span class="math">\((A_1), (A_2),\dots\)</span>.</p>

<p>Then the <em>sum</em> (written <span class="math">\(\alpha + \beta\)</span>) of two real numbers <span class="math">\(\alpha\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\beta\)</span> is defined as the real number (rational or irrational) which is determined by the <span class="math">\(L\)</span>-class <span class="math">\((A_1+B_1)\)</span> and the <span class="math">\(R\)</span>-class <span class="math">\((A_2+B_2)\)</span>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is, of course, necessary to prove that these classes determine a section of the rational numbers. It is evident that <span class="math">\(A_1+B_1  < A_2+B_2\)</span> and that at least one member of each of the classes <span class="math">\((A_1+B_1)\)</span>, <span class="math">\((A_2+B_2)\)</span> exists. It remains to prove that there is, at most, <em>one</em> rational number which is greater than every <span class="math">\(A_1+B_1\)</span> and less than every <span class="math">\(A_2+B_2\)</span>; suppose, if possible, that there are two, <span class="math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math">\(y \; (y>x)\)</span>. Let <span class="math">\(a_1\)</span> be a member of <span class="math">\((A_1)\)</span> and let <span class="math">\(a_2\)</span> be a member of <span class="math">\((A_2)\)</span>; and let <span class="math">\(N\)</span> be the integer next greater than <span class="math">\(\left. (\alpha_2-\alpha_1) \middle/\{ \frac{1}{2}(y-x) \} \right.\)</span>. Take the last of the numbers <span class="math">\(a_1+\displaystyle \frac{m}{N}(a_2-a_1)\)</span>, (where <span class="math">\(m=0, 1, \dots N\)</span>), which belongs to <span class="math">\((A_1)\)</span> and the first of them which belongs to <span class="math">\((A_2)\)</span>; let these two numbers be <span class="math">\(c_1, c_2\)</span>. Then <span class="math">\[ c_2-c_1 = \frac{1}{N}(a_2-a_1) < \frac{1}{2}(y-x). \]</span></p>

<p>Choose <span class="math">\(d_1, d_2\)</span> in a similar manner from the classes defining <span class="math">\(\beta\)</span>; then <span class="math">\[ c_2 + d_2 - c_1 - d_1 < y - x. \]</span></p>

<p>But <span class="math">\(c_2 + d_2 \geq y, \; c_1+d_1 \leq x\)</span>, and therefore <span class="math">\(c_2+d_2-c_1-d_1 \geq y-x;\)</span> we have therefore arrived at a contradiction by supposing that two rational numbers <span class="math">\(x,y\)</span> exist belonging neither to <span class="math">\((A_1+B_1)\)</span> nor to <span class="math">\((A_2+B_2)\)</span>.</p>

<p>If every rational number belongs either to the class <span class="math">\((A_1+B_1)\)</span> or to the class <span class="math">\((A_2+B_2)\)</span>, then the classes <span class="math">\((A_1+B_1)\)</span>, <span class="math">\((A_2+B_2)\)</span> define an irrational number.<a href="#fn:12" id="fnref:12" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[12]</a> If one rational number <span class="math">\(x\)</span> exists belonging to neither class, then the <span class="math">\(L\)</span>-class formed by <span class="math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math">\((A_1+B_1)\)</span> and the <span class="math">\(R\)</span>-class <span class="math">\((A_2+B_2)\)</span> define the rational-real number x. In either case, the number defined is called the sum <span class="math">\(\alpha + \beta\)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>The difference <span class="math">\(\alpha - \beta\)</span> of two real numbers is defined by the <span class="math">\(L\)</span>-class <span class="math">\((A_1-B_2)\)</span> and the <span class="math">\(R\)</span>-class <span class="math">\((A_2-B_1)\)</span>.</p>

<p>The product of two positive real numbers <span class="math">\(\alpha, \beta\)</span> is defined by the <span class="math">\(R\)</span>-class <span class="math">\((A_2B_2)\)</span> and the <span class="math">\(L\)</span>-class of all other rational numbers.</p>

<p>The reader will see without difficulty how to define the product of negative real numbers and the quotient of two real numbers; and further, it may be shewn that real numbers may be combined in accordance with the associative, distributive and commutative laws.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The aggregate of rational-real and irrational-real numbers is called the aggregate of real numbers; for brevity, rational-real numbers and irrational-real numbers are called rational and irrational numbers respectively.</p>

<h3 id="complexnumberssection">1.3 Complex numbers</h3>

<p>We have seen that a real number may be visualised as a displacement along a definite straight line. If, however, <span class="math">\(P\)</span> and <span class="math">\(Q\)</span> are any two points in a plane, the displacement <span class="math">\(\overline{PQ}\)</span> needs two real numbers for its specification; for instance, the differences of the coordinates of <span class="math">\(P\)</span> and <span class="math">\(Q\)</span> referred to fixed rectangular axes. If the coordinates of <span class="math">\(P\)</span> be <span class="math">\((\zeta, \eta)\)</span> and those of <span class="math">\(Q\)</span> <span class="math">\((\zeta+x,\eta+y)\)</span>, the displacement <span class="math">\(\overline{PQ}\)</span> may be described by the symbol <span class="math">\((x, y)\)</span>. We are thus led to consider the association of real numbers in ordered<a href="#fn:13" id="fnref:13" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[13]</a> pairs. The natural definition of the sum of two displacements <span class="math">\((x, y), \, (x' , y' )\)</span> is the displacement which is the result of the successive applications of the two displacements it is therefore convenient to define the sum of two number-pairs by the equation
<span class="math">\[ (x, y) + (x' , y' )=(x + x' , y + y' ). \]</span></p>

<p>The product of a number-pair and a real number <span class="math">\(x' \)</span> is then naturally defined by the equation
<span class="math">\[ x'  \times (x, y) = (x'  x, x'  y). \]</span></p>

<p>We are at liberty to define the product of two number-pairs in any convenient manner; but the only definition, which does not give rise to results that are merely trivial, is that symbolised by the equation
<span class="math">\[ (x,y) \times (x' ,y' ) = (xx'  - yy' , xy' +x' y). \]</span></p>

<p>It is then evident that
<span class="math">\[ \begin{align*}
                      (x, 0) \times (x' , y'  ) =&(xx' , xy') = x \times (x' , y' ) \\
\textrm{and} \quad (0, y) \times (x' , y' ) =&(- yy' , x' y) = y \times (- y' , x' ).
\end{align*} \]</span></p>

<p>The geometrical interpretation of these results is that the effect of multiplying by the displacement <span class="math">\((x, 0)\)</span> is the same as that of multiplying by the real number <span class="math">\(x\)</span>; but the effect of multiplying a displacement by <span class="math">\((0, y)\)</span> is to multiply it by a real number <span class="math">\(y\)</span> and turn it through a right angle.
It is convenient to denote the number-pair <span class="math">\((x, y)\)</span> by the compound symbol <span class="math">\(x + iy\)</span>; and a number-pair is now conveniently called (after Gauss) a <em>complex number</em>; in the fundamental operations of Arithmetic, the complex number <span class="math">\(x+ i0\)</span> may be replaced by the real number <span class="math">\(x\)</span> and, defining <span class="math">\(i\)</span> to mean <span class="math">\(0+i1\)</span>, we have <span class="math">\(i^2=(0,1) \times (0,1)=(-1,0)\)</span>; and so <span class="math">\(i^2\)</span> may be replaced by <span class="math">\(-1\)</span>.</p>

<p>The reader will easily be convinced that the definitions of addition and multiplication of number-pairs have been so framed that we may perform the ordinary operations of algebra with complex numbers in exactly the same way as with real numbers, treating the symbol <span class="math">\(i\)</span> as a number and replacing the product <span class="math">\(ii\)</span> by <span class="math">\(-1\)</span> wherever it occurs.</p>

<p>Thus the reader will verify that, if <span class="math">\(a, b, c\)</span> are complex numbers, we have </p>

<p><span class="math">\[ \begin{align*}
     a + b&=b + a, \\
         ab&=ba, \\
(a+b) +c&=a +(b + c), \\
      (ab)c&=a(bc), \\
  a(b + c)&=ab+ac, 
\end{align*} \]</span>
and if <span class="math">\(ab\)</span> is zero, then either <span class="math">\(a\)</span> or <span class="math">\(b\)</span> is zero.</p>

<p>It is found that algebraical operations, direct or inverse, when applied to complex numbers, do not suggest numbers of any fresh type; the complex number will therefore for our purposes be taken as the most general type of number.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The introduction of the complex number has led to many important developments in mathematics. Functions which, when real variables only are considered, appear as essentially distinct, are seen to be connected when complex variables are introduced: thus the circular functions are found to be expressible in terms of exponential functions of a complex argument, by the equations <span class="math">\[ \cos x= \frac{1}{2}(e^{ix} + e^{-ix}), \quad \sin x= \frac{1}{2}(e^{ix} - e^{-ix}). \]</span></p>

<p>Again, many of the most important theorems of modern analysis are not true if the numbers concerned are restricted to be real; thus, the theorem that every algebraic equation of degree <span class="math">\(n\)</span> has <span class="math">\(n\)</span> roots is true in general only when regarded as a theorem concerning complex numbers, Hamilton&#8217;s quaternions furnish an example of a still further extension of the idea of number. A quaternion <span class="math">\[ w+xi+yj + zk \]</span> is formed from four real numbers <span class="math">\(w\)</span>, <span class="math">\(x\)</span>, <span class="math">\(y,\)</span> <span class="math">\(z\)</span>, and four number-units <span class="math">\(1\)</span>, <span class="math">\(i\)</span>, <span class="math">\(j\)</span>, <span class="math">\(k\)</span> in the same way that the ordinary complex number <span class="math">\(x + iy\)</span> might be regarded as being formed from two real numbers <span class="math">\(x, y\)</span>, and two number-units <span class="math">\(1\)</span>, <span class="math">\(i\)</span>. Quaternions however do not obey the commutative law of multiplication.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="themodulusofacomplexnumber">1.4 The modulus of a complex number</h3>

<p>Let <span class="math">\(x + iy\)</span> be a complex number, <span class="math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math">\(y\)</span> being real numbers. Then the positive square root of <span class="math">\(x^2+y^2\)</span> is called the <em>modulus</em> of <span class="math">\((x + iy)\)</span>, and is written
<span class="math">\[ \left|\, x + iy \,\right| .\]</span></p>

<p>Let us consider the complex number which is the sum of two given complex numbers, <span class="math">\(x + iy\)</span> and <span class="math">\(u + iv\)</span>. We have
<span class="math">\[ (x + iy) + (u + iv) = (x + u) + i (y + v). \]</span></p>

<p>The modulus of the sum of the two numbers is therefore
<span class="math">\[  \{(x+u)^2+(y +v)^2 \}^{\frac{1}{2}}\!, \; \textrm{or}  \]</span>
<span class="math">\[  \{ (x^2 +y^2) +(u^2 +v^2) + 2(xu +yv) \}^{\frac{1}{2}}\!. \]</span></p>

<p>But <span class="math">\[ \begin{align*} 
& \{ \left|\, x+iy \,\right|+\left|\, u +iv \,\right| \}^2 \\
&\begin{array}{rl}
\quad &= \{ (x^2+y^2)^{\frac{1}{2}} + (u^2+v^2)^{\frac{1}{2}} \}^2  \\
         &= (x^2 +y^2) +(u^2 +v^2)+ 2(x^2+y^2)^{\frac{1}{2}}(u^2+v^2)^{\frac{1}{2}}\\ 
         &=  (x^2 +y^2) +(u^2 +v^2) + 2\{ (xu+yv)^2+(xv-yu)^2 \}^{\frac{1}{2}}\!,
\end{array} 
\end{align*} \]</span>
and this latter expression is greater than (or at least equal to)
<span class="math">\[ (x^2 +y^2) +(u^2 +v^2) + 2 (xu+yv). \]</span></p>

<p>We have therefore
<span class="math">\[ \left|\, x+iy \,\right|+\left|\, u +iv \,\right|  \geq \left|\,  (x + iy) + (u + iv) \,\right|, \]</span>
i.e. <em>the modulus of the sum of two complex numbers cannot be greater than the sum of their moduli</em>; and it follows by induction that the modulus of the sum of any number of complex numbers cannot be greater than the sum of their moduli.</p>

<p>Let us consider next the complex number which is the product of two given complex numbers, <span class="math">\(x + iy\)</span> and <span class="math">\(u + iv\)</span>; we have
<span class="math">\[ \begin{align*}
(x + iy) (u + iv) &=(xu - yv) + i (xv + yu), 
\end{align*} \]</span>
and therefore
<span class="math">\[ \begin{align*}
\quad \left|\,(x + iy) (u + iv)\,\right| &=\{(xu - yv)^2 + (xv + yu)^2\}^{\frac{1}{2}}, \\
&=\{(x^2 + y^2)(u^2 + v^2)\}^{\frac{1}{2}}, \\
&=\left|\,x + iy\,\right| \, \left|\,u + iv\,\right|. 
\end{align*} \]</span>
<em>The modulus of the product of two complex numbers</em> (and hence, by induction, of any number of complex numbers) <em>is therefore equal to the product of their moduli.</em></p>

<h3 id="thearganddiagram">1.5 The Argand diagram</h3>

<p>We have seen that complex numbers may be represented in a geometrical diagram by taking rectangular axes <span class="math">\(Ox\)</span>, <span class="math">\(Oy\)</span> in a plane. Then a point <span class="math">\(P\)</span> whose coordinates referred to these axes are <span class="math">\(x,\, y\)</span> may be regarded as representing the complex number <span class="math">\(x + iy\)</span>. In this way, to every point of the plane there corresponds some one complex number; and, conversely, to every possible complex number there corresponds one, and only one, point of the plane.</p>

<p>The complex number <span class="math">\(x + iy\)</span> may be denoted by a single letter <span class="math">\(z\)</span>.<a href="#fn:14" id="fnref:14" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[14]</a> The point <span class="math">\(P\)</span> is then called the <em>representative point</em> of the number <span class="math">\(z\)</span>; we shall also speak of the number <span class="math">\(z\)</span> as being the <em>affix</em> of the point <span class="math">\(P\)</span>.</p>

<p>If we denote <span class="math">\( (x^2+y^2)^{\frac{1}{2}}\)</span> by <span class="math">\(r\)</span> and choose <span class="math">\(\theta\)</span> so that <span class="math">\(r \cos \theta = x\)</span>, <span class="math">\(r \sin \theta =y\)</span>, then <span class="math">\(r\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\theta\)</span> are clearly the radius vector and vectorial angle of the point <span class="math">\(P\)</span>, referred to the origin <span class="math">\(O\)</span> and axis <span class="math">\(Ox\)</span>.</p>

<p>The representation of complex numbers thus afforded is often called the <em>Argand diagram</em>.<a href="#fn:15" id="fnref:15" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[15]</a></p>

<p>By the definition already given, it is evident that <span class="math">\(r\)</span> is the modulus of <span class="math">\(z\)</span>. The angle <span class="math">\(\theta\)</span> is called the <em>argument</em>, or <em>amplitude</em>, or <em>phase</em>, of <span class="math">\(z\)</span>.</p>

<h6 id="1.5principalvalue">We write <span class="math">\[ \theta=  \arg z. \]</span> From geometrical considerations, it appears that (although the modulus of a complex number is unique) the argument is not unique;<a href="#fn:16" id="fnref:16" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[16]</a> if <span class="math">\(\theta\)</span> be a value of the argument, the other values of the argument are comprised in the expression <span class="math">\(2n \pi+\theta\)</span> where <span class="math">\(n\)</span> is any integer, not zero. The <em>principal</em> value of <span class="math">\(\arg z\)</span> is that which satisfies the inequality <span class="math">\(-\pi < \arg z \leq \pi\)</span>.</h6>

<p>If <span class="math">\(P_1\)</span> and <span class="math">\(P_2\)</span> are the representative points corresponding to values <span class="math">\(z_1\)</span> and <span class="math">\(z_2\)</span> respectively of <span class="math">\(z\)</span>, then the point which represents the value <span class="math">\(z_1 +z_2\)</span> is clearly the terminus of a line drawn from <span class="math">\(P_1\)</span>, equal and parallel to that which joins the origin to <span class="math">\(P_2\)</span>.</p>

<p>To find the point which represents the complex number <span class="math">\(z_1 z_2\)</span>, where <span class="math">\(z_1\)</span> and <span class="math">\(z_2\)</span> are two given complex numbers, we notice that if
<span class="math">\[ \begin{align*}
z_1 &= r_1 (\cos \theta_1 + i \sin \theta_1), \\
z_2 &= r_2 (\cos \theta_2 + i \sin \theta_2) 
\end{align*} \]</span>
then, by multiplication,
<span class="math">\[ z_1 z_2= r_1 r_2 \{ \cos (\theta_1  + \theta_2) + i \sin (\theta_1  + \theta_2) \}. \]</span></p>

<p>The point which represents the number <span class="math">\(z_1 z_2\)</span> has therefore a radius vector
measured by the product of the radii vectores of <span class="math">\(P_1\)</span> and <span class="math">\(P_2\)</span>, and a vectorial angle equal to the sum of the vectorial angles of <span class="math">\(P_1\)</span> and <span class="math">\(P_2\)</span>.</p>

<p>This procedure formed the basis of the treatment of irrational numbers by the Greek mathematicians in the sixth and fifth centuries B.C.
