## Construction Notes ##

These notes are reminders of issues that have come up in building this website. They may appear and disappear as the site develops. If you think you can help, feel free to email me at [nithardt@uw.edu](mailto:nithardt@uw.edu).

### Missing References ###

W&W have included a lot of references, all of which are old enough to be in the public domain. For many, I have found and linked to on-line versions. For some references, I have had no luck finding. This is a running list of such references.

*Chapter 1.*

All found

*Chapter 2.*

1. [Bolzano, Abh. der k. böhmischen Gen. der Wiss. v. (1817).](CMA02-1-Limits.html#bolzanosection)
2. [this result (divergence of harmonic series) was noticed by Leibniz in 1673.](CMA02-2-Series.html#convergenceofaninfiniteseries)
3. [the expressions convergent and divergent were introduced by James Gregory, Professor of Mathematics at Edinburgh, in the same year (1668).](CMA02-2-Series.html#convergenceofaninfiniteseries) 
3. [he (Newton) investigated the convergence of hypergeometric series in 1704.](CMA02-2-Series.html#convergenceofaninfiniteseries)
4.  [It (the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem) seems to have been known to Cauchy.](CMA02-1-Limits.html#bolzanosection)
5.  [These methods (of summing double series) are due to Cauchy.](CMA02-3-MoreSeries.html#methodsofsummingdoubleseries)
6.  [The convergence of the product in which a_{n−1}=−1/n^2 was investigated by Wallis as early as 1655.](CMA02-4-Products.html#infiniteproducts)
7.  [Infinite determinants had previously occurred in the researches of Fürstenau on the algebraic equation of the 7th degree, Darstellung der reellen Wurzeln algebraischer Gleichungen durch Determinanten der Coeffizienten (Marburg, 1860).](CMA02-4-Products.html#infinitedeterminants)
8. [(de la Vallee Poussin, Mém. de l’Acad. de Belgique, LIII. (1896), no. 6.)](CMA02-4-Products.html#miscellaneousexamples) Example 10.

W&W have given references for some examples, but many of these references are almost useless, like (Cauchy.). There are some, like (Trinity, 1904.), (Peterhouse, 1906.), or  (Math. Trip., 1906.), which appear to reference specific college exams. I have found no on-line source for these, however.

### Unresolved Examples ###

Here, I am keeping a running list of examples that I have been unable to solve or, as for starred items, I have only an ugly or over complicated solution. I am open to an exchange of hints or ideas, but please do not e-mail unsolicited solutions.
